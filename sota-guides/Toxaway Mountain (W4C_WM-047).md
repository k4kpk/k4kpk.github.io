Drive to Trailhead & Trail Guide - Toxaway Mtn
--------------------------------------------------------
#### Drive Guide - Toxaway Mountain from Rabun Bald

* **Duration**: 1:15, 33 miles
* **Google Maps** 
* **Seasonal/Limited Access**: 
    * Tower Rd is a one lane paved road with turn outs.  It is a very slow drive.
    * There is a 100' stretch of dirt road, 1/4 mile before the top.  High ground clearance required.  I dragged bottom in my Prius.  I *might* be able to make it in my Corolla, but there is risk of trail rash from driving on the shoulder.  There is NO place to park without driving on the dirt.  The dirt stretch is still there in 2015.
* **Directions**:
    * Drive out on the only road for 0.5
    * R on Bald Mtn Rd / Hale Ridge Rd and go 3.3
    * R at Dillard Rd/GA-246/NC-246/NC-106 and go 7.3
    * R on US-64 / Main St go 0.3
        * You will get cell service just before this point.  The Post Office on the left at this corner is a good spot to fiddle with your phone.
    * L on US-64 East and go 17.3
        * At about 10 miles, look for a dark green strip mall named "Creekside".  This is just prior to the main intersection in Cashiers, NC.
            * Opportunities for food and restroom:
                * There is a "stealth" Wendy's in this shopping center.
                * There is a Subway just past the intersection.
                * There is an Ingles just past the Subway.
    * L on Black Oak Dr and then L on Black Oak Dr at T and go 0.2 past T
    * Bear L on Hickory Dr and go 1
    * R on Tower Rd at T and go 0.3
    * Acute L on Tower Rd after hairpin turn and go 0.4
    * R on Tower Rd and go 2.2
        * It looks like the last driveway (on L) before the water tank turn-out on the R is the edge of the activation zone.  I ran down to the prior driveway (on R), to be sure I was out of the zone.

* **Food**
    * Limited options

* **Duration**: 0:15 (to exit and re-enter the zone; it is a drive-up)
* **Navigation**:  Follow the dirt road.  At the first turn-out (on the R), there is a dirt road to your right. You keep L.  KI4SVM operated from the 2nd turn-out (on the L)
* **Summit altitude**: 4777' at 35.1319, -82.9831
* **GPS tracks/waypoints**:
    * End of pavement: 35.131222, -82.983638

#### Summit Guide

* Hang antenna from tree: Y
* Space to guy mast: Y
* Cell coverage: AT&T=Y (with strong 3G); Vzn and APRS not tested but KI4SVM says they're good.
* Unique features: Fire tower, house, antenna farm on summit.  
    * I operated from the turn-out on the left, just below the summit.  I had no QRM, but there might be some on the summit.  The turn-out was a sandy mess.
    * If I do this site again, I'll try the grassy summit. I have a portable SW receiver that I'll take and I'll use it to measure QRM on summit before setting up an antenna.
* KI4SVM (Pat) has a picture showing that he activated from near the fire tower on the summit.  He says he had no problem with QRM in late 2014.
* I had moderate, intermittent QRM near the fire tower in 2015
