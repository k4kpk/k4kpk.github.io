# Drive to Trailhead & Trail Guide - Toxaway Mtn

The drive on Tower Road from US-64 to the summit to the summit is about 25 minutes. It is narrow, paved, and 1-lane. The dirt stretch had a nasty tilt and I scraped bushes in October 2021. I scraped bottom once. it was drivable in my Corolla. The left track (headed up) of the twin-track acts as a stream following a rain, so it can erode quickly. In a small car, you can just **barely** squeeze onto the mid-to-right-track, with some bush scraping.
