#### Summit Guide

* The ugly summit is filled with a concrete block building, radio towers and guy lines.  The ground is a hard gravel parking lot.  There's a large clearing past the towers, but it is below the activation zone.
* 2014: I strapped my mast to a post on the left, between the driveway to the first building and the big lot.  The post has a sign which says not to drive past that point.  It is overgrown, so it is hard to see.  Medium QRM from air conditioning in buildings.
* 2015: I set up 150' down the road -- about halfway between the field at the turn (which is the edge of the activation zone) and the first building at the top.  No QRM trouble from this point.  I set up off to the left of the road, across the ditch.  (Might be messy in the green season.)
* 2m frequently breaks squelch, perhaps from noise on 2m from the radios.  Mild RFI on 20m from transformers and air conditioning. 40m is clear.
* There is a gate at 0.7 from the summit.  It was locked in November of 2015.  It may be a new perma-gate, or it may have been seasonal.  It is about a 15 minute walk up from the gate.  
* Cell coverage: APRS: message delivered but ACK not received in 2013, failed in 2014; Verizon: 1 of 3 succeeded (2014);  AT&T: no signal 2014; AT&T good SMS 2015.
