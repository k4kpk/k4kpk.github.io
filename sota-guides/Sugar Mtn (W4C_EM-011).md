#### Pre-planning notes:

* AC4M says: For Sugar Mountain it is mostly residential all the way to the top, since there is not a whole lot of people around at the top, we just parked at the top and walked a very short distance to the summit on a small rock outcroppings.  on Trails end road I think it is called. You can see a trail leading into the under growth up there.
