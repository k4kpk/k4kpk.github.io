Note: Via Rattlesnake Gap climbs 200' less than from Lemon Gap, feels easier and is a few minutes faster (including the drive). Lemon Gap is prettier.

Drive to Trailhead & Trail Guide - Walnut Mountain
--------------------------------------------------------

Note: Parking can be full at Lemon Gap.  At 11 AM on a clear Saturday, I too the last sensible parking space. Rattlesnake has plenty parking. Lemon Gap trail is more pleasant: wooded, green.  Rattlesnake Gap has lots of un-shaded, slash-and-clear road.

#### Trail Guide from Lemon Gap

* **Duration**: 1.4 miles 750' climb, 0:40 up (when fresh), 0:30 down
    * Note: Allow 0:45 for setup, if you're going to use the J-pole for 146.52
* **Navigation**
    * Follow AT 1.25 North to Walnut Mtn shelter at 35.8365,-82.93649
    * Follow faint trail past shelter, to left of AT, 0.2 to summit at 35.8367, -82.9341
    * Note: Shelter is about 50' elevation below summit, as measured by my GPS.
    * Grab the first good clear spot you see at or past the shelter.  There's nothing good at the apex.
* **Trailhead altitude**: 3550
* **Summit altitude**: 4300
* **GPS tracks/waypoints**:
    * Trailhead: 35.82536, -82.93744

#### Trail Guide from Rattlesnake Gap
* **Duration**: 1.4 miles (565' climb), 0:45 up, 0:30 down (via gated road - not the shortcut trail)
* **Navigation**:
    * USFS-96 comes into a T at Rattlesnake Gap.  96 turns R on the top-right of the T.  There's a seasonally gated road making the top-left of the T.
    * There's another dirt road that ends inside the right-turn of 96.  Standing in the gap, face SE and walk toward 35.847824, -82.94429.  It arrives at a gate pretty quickly.  This is the trail. (FS Trail 135.)
    * Follow this road to the Walnut Mtn shelter, in Walnut Gap.
    * Coming back from the shelter, there is a sign near the shelter that points to a well-defined trail marked "Rattlesnake Gap 0.9 miles".
    * Pat Harris has a GPX trace at [http://smkymtns.com/sota-resources/sota-gpx-tracks/viewtrack/118-/118-.html](http://smkymtns.com/sota-resources/sota-gpx-tracks/viewtrack/118-/118-.html)
    * Going up, you'll encounter a "Walnut Trail" sign, part way up.  This is a shortcut.  You won't be able to find the other end on the way back down (35.8388,-82.93836) unless you hike the shortcut up. The shortcut is overgrown and becomes a bushwhack. I do not recommend it.
* **GPS tracks/waypoints**:
    * Rattlesnake Gap: 35.84758,-82.94426
