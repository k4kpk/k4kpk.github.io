####Trail Guide from Rattlesnake Gap####
* **Duration**: 1.4 miles (565' climb), 0:45 up, 0:35 down (via gated road - not the shortcut trail)
* **Navigation**:
    * USFS-96 comes into a T at Rattlesnake Gap.  96 turns R on the top-right of the T.  There's a seasonally gated road making the top-left of the T.
    * There's another dirt road that ends inside the right-turn of 96.  Standing in the gap, face SE and walk toward 35.847824, -82.94429.  It arrives at a gate pretty quickly.  This is the trail. (FS Trail 135.)
    * Follow this road to the Walnut Mtn shelter, in Walnut Gap.
    * This might be 1/10 mile longer than from Lemon Gap, but it climbs 200' less.  I think it is easier.
    * Coming back from the shelter, there is a sign near the shelter that points to a well-defined trail marked "Rattlesnake Gap 0.9 miles".  
    * Pat Harris has a GPX trace at [http://smkymtns.com/sota-resources/sota-gpx-tracks/viewtrack/118-/118-.html](http://smkymtns.com/sota-resources/sota-gpx-tracks/viewtrack/118-/118-.html)
    * Going up, you'll encounter a "Walnut Trail" sign, part way up.  This is a shortcut.  Pat says it comes out in the clearing near the top, but I didn't see it.  I thought I'd hike up on the road and down on the shortcut, but I couldn't find the top.  If you want to compare it, hike *up* the shortcut and *down* the road.  Pat says it is much shorter but steeper. Pa says it enters the clearing downhill from where the road enters the clearing.
