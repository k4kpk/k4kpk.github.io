#### Trail Guide

* **Duration**: 1:10 up; 0:50 down
* **Navigation**
    * Excerpted from Pat: 1.25-1.5 mile hike, 740' climb. Start hike on gated FS Rd 236C. At 0.3, side trail heads left up old logging road on the ridgeline. I chose to follow the main road a bit further before venturing off-trail, which made for a steeper climb to regain the ridgeline. On descent, I followed the ridgeline down and as I expected, I found the other end of the logging road previously mentioned. I recommend taking the left turn at 0.3 miles for a more enjoyable hike.
