* **Navigation**
    * Beegum Gap Trailhead (2 miles; +1000')
         * Elevation 3690'
         * After the pavement ends, continue in the same direction 30'. The left fork is the trail (which joins the Bartram Trail) and the right fork is the jeep road.  They'll meet up about half-way to the top.  Shorter route is the trail to the left:
         * There is a sign post.  There is also a post with a green blaze.
         * Bartram is yellow blazed (when you get to it, after about 0.2 miles).
         * Stay on the main trail to the right, when you reach the Bartram.
         * At 0.8 miles, the trail meets the jeep trail at a 4x4 camp area.
         * The Bartram Trail to the summit continues on the left.
    * From Hale Ridge Rd Trailhead (2.9 miles; +2100') (per my yellow Bartram Trail book from http://www.emapstore.com/outdoor/hike/bartram_trail.html):
            * Trail marker is on left side of road (headed N on Hale Ridge Rd).

      * Summit: 34.9656, -83.2998		Grid: EM84ix

#### Summit Guide

* Antenna: The only sensible antenna setup is to climb to the top of the tower and bungee cord a mast to the railing.
    * If you are really stubborn, you can tie one end of your antenna to the railing and run an antenna to one of the trees below the tower.
* Cell coverage: AT&T 2015 SMS success; AT&T 2014 = intermittent; Verizon 2014 = intermittent; APRS = good send/receive.
    * I had best success with Verizon by putting the phone flat on the deck and giving it some space.
* Unique features:
    * 20' stone tower atop the summit.  Great views.
    * I reached an Alpharetta ham on 2 meters FM National Calling Frequency.
