* **Navigation**
    * After pavement ends, continue in same direction 30'. The left fork is the trail (which joins the Bartram Trail) and the right fork is the jeep road.  They'll meet about half-way to the top.  Shorter route is the trail.
         * There is a sign post.  There is also a post with a green blaze.
         * Bartram is yellow blazed (when you get to it, after about 0.2 miles).
         * Stay on the main trail to the right, when you reach the Bartram.

    * Summit: 34.9656, -83.2998   Grid: EM84ix at 4696' altitude

#### Summit Guide

* Antenna: The only sensible antenna setup is to climb to the top of the tower and bungee cord a mast to the railing.
* Cell coverage: AT&T 2015 SMS success; AT&T 2014 = intermittent; Verizon 2014 = intermittent; APRS = good send/receive.
    * I had best success with Verizon by putting the phone flat on the deck and giving it some space.
* Unique features:
    * 20' stone tower atop the summit.  Great views.
    * I reached an Alpharetta ham on 2 meters FM National Calling Frequency.
