####Trail Guide

* **Duration**:
* **Navigation**
    * Trailhead is past a dirt hump on left shoulder of USFS-25.  Follow old roadbed toward the summit. 
    * The whole hike is in the activation zone.  Set up at the first appealing spot.
    * As the roadbed nears summit, it forks. L fork becomes indistinct. Set up at or before the fork.  There is nothing better at the true summit, and you could easily get lost if your GPS fails.
