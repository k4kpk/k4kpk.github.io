    * Follow the closed, grassy road from corner of parking area.
    * Pass through first clearing.  Continue to follow the road through clearing.  If obscured by snow, just head to north edge of clearing.
    * Follow road to summit in second clearing.
    * Activation zone: When the trail enters the clearing on Huckleberry Knob, you are 60' below the high point.  If you needed to, you could operate from here.

#### Summit Guide

* Hang antenna from tree: not on top; there are some low trees at the edge of the clearing, which are just inside the activation zone.  You could run something between them, but I don't think any are 30' tall.
