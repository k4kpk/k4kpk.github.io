#### Trail Guide

* **Duration**: 0:35 up (0.7 miles); 20 minutes down
* **Navigation**
    * Follow abandoned road from the entry side of parking lot (not the nice trail, at the far end of the lot).
    * Road is overgrown with rhododendron.  It is passable, but won't be in a few years.  Also has many briars.
    * At 35.36124,-84.10434, you'll see a saddle to your R.  You can follow the former driveway for the (now gone) fire tower up the ridge to the summit.  Caution: Many, many briars.
    * You might do better to walk to 35.36068,-84.10376 and head up the side of the hill.
    * I stopped about 20' short of the summit, because the briars became too intense.  You might have better luck from a different angle.
