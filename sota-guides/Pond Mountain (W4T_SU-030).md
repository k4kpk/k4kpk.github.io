#### Trail Guide

* **Duration**: 2 miles; 1:40 up, 1:30 down.
* **Navigation**
    * See http://www.peakbagger.com/climber/ascent.aspx?aid=286881
    * Blue blazed; poorly maintained; overgrows; check topo, but it doesn't match the topo.
    * The first 1.4 miles follow an old road that contours along the W flank of Rough Ridge, and the last 0.7 is an assault on the ridge, gaining 540 feet in just 0.4 miles. The trail does cross directly over the summit.
    * Cross 5 berms to reach an abandoned dirt road. Follows the winding road, climbing gently. 
    * After 1.0 mile on the road, elevation 3660, you’ll see a dip in the ridge on your R. 
    * Leave the trail here and climb through open woods to reach the ridge at 3700. 
    * Turn L (north) and walk up onto the 3880 ridge that leads N/NE toward the summit.
    * At 1.5 miles, you’ll encounter the blue blazes again. 
        * To your left, the Pond Mountain Trail followed the road a total of 1.4 miles from the trailhead and went down and then up steeply to reach the ridge. You short-cutted several hundred yards and reduced your climb.
    * At 1.75 miles (4240') you reach boulders on the SW end of the summit ridge. The summit is 0.25 miles NE. Trail is poorly marked and overgrown.  Treat it like a bushwhack.
