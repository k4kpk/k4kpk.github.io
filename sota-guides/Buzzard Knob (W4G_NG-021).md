####Trail Guide

* **Durations (Buzzard, then Little Bald 2013)**: 3:00 - 3.5 Miles total, but it includes significant bushwhack.
    * 2:30 - 3.3 miles, Dicks Creek Gap to Buzzard Knob. 1100' total climb + 400' dip to Cowart Gap. Medium-difficulty bushwhack in summer.
    * 2:00 - 2.1 miles, Buzzard Knob to Little Bald Knob. Cowart Gap to summit is 3/4 mile and 500' climb.  Tough bushwhack in summer.
* **Durations (Little Bald, then Buzzard 2014)**:
    * 1:15 - Parking to Little Bald
    * 1:30 - On summit, Little Bald Knob
    * 1:45 - Little Bald Knob to Buzzard Knob
    * 1:15 - On summit, Buzzard Knob
    * 1:50 - Buzzard Knob to parking
    * Note: This was so fast that I hurt a **lot** afterward.  Take more rest breaks and don't push so hard the next time.
* **Navigation**
    * Follow the AT blazes.
    * Bushwhack to Buzzard from N34.93261 W83.60191
    * Bushwhack to Little Bald from N34.91090 W83.60449 or N34.91260 W83.60179 and I don't like either one.
        * I went up from the second and down to the first in September 2013.  Miserable.
        * I went up from the first and down from the second in January 2014. Hike up the hill was strenuous, but bushwhack was easier with winter die-off.  The bushwhack down wasn't too bad.
* **Trailhead altitude**: 2675' at Dicks Creek Gap
* **Summit altitude**:
    * Little Bald Knob: 3460'
    * Buzzard Knob: 3740'
* **GPS tracks/waypoints**:
    * Dicks Creek Gap Trailhead: 34.91201, -83.61855

####Summit Guide

* Hang antenna from tree: Heavy vegetation makes it challenging.
* Space to guy mast: Heavy vegetation makes it challenging.
* Cell coverage: Good. AT&T had 3G internet. VZN SMS good. No APRS msgs or beacons worked.

####Scouting After Hike

* Scout the drive to Rock Mtn (NG-024) via Finney Creek Rd.  You can't get there via Courthouse Gap Rd because it becomes a private road near its start.
