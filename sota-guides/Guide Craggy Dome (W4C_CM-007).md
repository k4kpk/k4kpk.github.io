Drive to Trailhead & Trail Guide

####Drive Guide - Craggy Dome From Atlanta

NOTE: I've decided this is such a miserable hike and an ovegrown summit that after activating it twice, I'm not going to activate it again -- even for 10 points and even to make a triple-header possible.  It isn't any fun.

* **Navigation**
    * Bring a jacket in the summer: On July 11, 2015 at 10 A.M. the weather was 59 degrees, windy, with dense fog.
    * It is an intense climb due to overgrown trail with steep spots; for large parts of the trail, you can't see where you are putting your feet.
	* Walk 85 yards on parkway toward the Craggy Gardens visitor center on left shoulder of road
	* At MST post on left, turn L onto Mountains to Sea Trail.
	* At 12 yards, see large boulder on R.  In 6 more yards, depart trail to R.
	* Bushwhack about 5 minutes to find manway.
	* Manway is overgrown (in mid-September 2014).
	* You will need to find the manway before reaching dense laurel, in order to make it through.

    * Leave MST: 35.71008,-82.36472

####Summit Guide

* Miserable.  There is no real space to operate on the summit.  There is a too-small rock in the middle of the trail, which is the only 'clearing' you can sit in, and there's not enough room for all my stuff.
* Hang antenna from tree: No. Dense mountain laurel on summit.
* Space to guy mast: No, but you can bungee it to the mountain laurel.
* Cell coverage: 2014: ATT=no; VZN=marginal; APRS=yes. In July 2015, my VZN phone got out 3 of 5 SMS attempts.
