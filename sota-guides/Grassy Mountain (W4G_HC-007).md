Grassy Mtn - Drive to Trailhead & Trail Guide
--------------------------------------------------------
#### Drive Guide - Grassy Mtn From Atlanta

* **Special**: Take cash ($2 in 2013) to pay parking fee.
* **Duration**: 2:30
* **Google Maps** URL from Atlanta (33.91998, -84.33898): 
    * Via Ellijay: http://goo.gl/maps/wcc21
    * The part of the Google directions after Bald Mountain are confusing.
* **Seasonal/Limited Access**:
    * Picnic and campground were closed in 2012.11.18 when I visited; the boat ramp was open.
    * Appears that the boat ramp and "overflow camping" is closed after Dec 31 until spring.  
    * Overflow camping is open after the regular camping because it has no running water.
    * At the "Conasauga T" (34.84158, -84.59447), there's a gate blocking the R turn during winter. A little ways up the road to the L (past some cabins) there's a gate that might get closed in January and February.
* **Directions**: Ellijay Route 2:15 (Chattsworth drive moved to separate file.  30 minutes longer.) 
    * Caution. Google Maps has an obsession with USFS-78/78G, which is a jeep trail intersecting Old CCC Camp Rd at 34.815539, -84.666.
    * I-285 West, I-75 North
    * I-575 North. Reset trip odometer.  Continue onto GA-5 and GA-515.  Go 54 miles to Ellijay McDonalds.
    * Go 0.5 past Ellijay McDonalds.
    * Left on 1st Ave, to cross bridge to Ellijay. Go 0.1
    * Left on River St (a.k.a. GA-52). Go 1 mile
    * Ellijay downtown roundabout. Stay on 52 and go 5.1 to Gates Chapel Rd.
        **From Gates Chapel Rd**:
        * R on Gates Chapel Rd.  (There's a pond that you'll see just after you turn.)  Go 5.4.
          * Pavement ends at fork.  Bear R on Wilderness Trail (Becomes FS90) Go 1.5.
          * Hairpin R onto FS 68 (a.k.a. Conasauga Rd), go 3.2.
          * L on Conasauga Lake Rd (FS 68 goes L; FS 64 goes R) at "Conasauga T" (34.84158, -84.59447).  Go 3.4.
          * **BALD MTN TRAILHEAD**: At this point, you are at the trailhead for Bald Mountain.
              * (Note to self: Retain this.  Bald Mtn trip refers the reader here.)
          * Continue on FS 68 / Conasauga Rd.  See "Final Turns" below.
    * **Final turns - from Bald Mtn / Tearbritches Trail**:
        * On USFS-68 at Tearbritches Trail (Bald Mtn trailhead and also group camp driveway) heading west, **go 0.4**.
        * At camping entrance, go straight - do not turn R to "Camping Loop A."  **Go 0.6**.
            * Do NOT park in the campground.  They will ticket you.
        * Follow main road slightly to right.  (Don't turn left.) ** and go 0.2**.
        * At this point you can choose whether to hike the trail or the gravel road:
            * To gravel road route:
                * Continue straight onto road/trail 49 toward overflow camping and Windy gap Cycle Trail.  **Go 0.6**.
                * Park at the gate at the end of the road.  Hike the gravel road to the top.
            * To trail past the dam:
                * Bear R on 68A toward picnic and boat-launch areas.  Go 0.1.
                * The road to the boat ramp turns L on USFS-68C.  If picnic area is open, continue straight.  Picnic area was gated in November.
                    * Picnic area parking is in a few hundred feet.  It has flush toilets.
                    * If you go to the boat ramp:
                        * Park in parking area near (not at) the boat ramp.  No restroom in this area. GPS coordinates: 34.86002, -84.65275
                        * Walk the circum-lake trail counter-clockwise about 0.1 mile to reach the dam.

#### Trail Guide - Gravel Road From Overflow Camping ("Gravel Road")

* **Duration**: 0:40
* **Navigation**: Just follow the gravel road to the fire tower at the summit.

#### Trail Guide - Hiking Trails Past the Dam ("Trails")

* **Duration**: 1:20
* **Navigation**
    * The hike took 1:20 going in and 47 minutes coming back, moving fast.
    * The trail notes begin from the dam, at Lake Conasauga. There's a trail around the lake.
    * You want to start your hike proceeding counter-clockwise, from mid-dam.
    * At the end of the dam, turn right on trail 99.
    * Follow the trail. After a bit, it will head downhill a lot. It is a good trail, but in Fall, it can be indistinct, due to heavy leaf cover.
    * You'll come to a T, with a huge trail map sign. (You enter the T from the base.)
    * Turn right. Almost immediately, you'll cross a beaver dam.
    * Immediately after crossing the dam, take the trail to your left.
    * When Songbird and the Fire Tower trails split, take the right fork. It has a metal post with "99" on it.
    * When you pass a large boulder on your right, in a small valley, look right. The trail makes a 90 degree right turn here. Hikers sometimes miss this turn. There may be small, bright green, metal tags, but vandals sometimes remove blazes.
    * After a long, up-hill slog, you'll join the grassy dirt road, running up the ridge to the fire tower.
    * There's a big clearing at the fire tower. It is a short, wide tower.
