Drive to Trailhead & Trail Guide - Yellow Bald
--------------------------------------------------------

* Note: If you elect to pair this with a summit to the west (e.g. Standing Indian), see my guide for Tray Mountain for related directions.

####Drive Guide - Yellow Bald from ATLANTA

* **Duration**: 2:30 (actual, 2015)
* **Google Maps** URL from Ashford Dunwoody Rd and I-285 at 33.91998, -84.33898: http://goo.gl/maps/l7kIQ
* **Seasonal/Limited Access**: Last part is gated in winter.  In summer of 2016 there were 3 deep erosion gullies making the Ball Creek Rd (USFS-83) route questionable; considr taking USFS-67 from Wallace Gap (near Standing Indian Campground)
* **Directions**:
    * I-285 E
    * I-85 N
    * I-985 / GA-365 N and go 52.6
    * US-441 N and go 35.1
    * L on Coweeta Lab Rd and go 0.8
        * This is 12.1 north of US-76 and McDonalds in Clayton, GA.
        * Look for a brown "Coweeta" sign on the left.
        * From this turn to parking is about 0:35
    * R fork on Coweeta / 1112 (merges back into 1110) and go 2.1
    * Straight onto Ball Creek Rd / USFS-83 and go 4.1 (turns to dirt here)
        * This dirt road is unusually well maintained, all the way to summit parking.  Smooth and easy to drive in my Corolla.
    * Road turns R and forks (L fork is USFS-421) at wide spot on turn. Take R-most onto Ball Creek Rd heading up-hill and go 2.1
        * Crosses "Pickens Nose Trail at 1.4"
    * Cross the AT and go 0.5
    * R onto USFS-67 (sign to Albert Mtn) and go 2.0
        * Note: USFS-67 runs to Wallace Gap near Standing Indian Campground.
    * Park in parking space for 8-10 cars, with field to left at end of road.
    * There is a map showing the last bit of USFS-67 at http://atatdusk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_3393-Small.jpg (It is a scan of a "Trails Illustrated" map, by National Geographic.
    * See Tusquitee Ranger District Nantahala National Forest Motor Vehicle Use Map 2013 edition.  (The 2007 edition lacks the table of dates.  The 2013 edition has the table, but it does not include USFS-67!  I'm guessing USFS-67 is open April 1 to December 31.)
* **Food**
    * Last McDonalds: Clayton, GA (busy on Saturday morning)
    * Penultimate McDonalds: Cornelia, on Level Grove Rd.
        * It comes just BEFORE Cornelia and your exit to USâ€“441.

####Drive Guide - Yellow Bald TO US-441
* **Directions**: about 0:35
    * Drive back the way you came in and go 2.1
    * L onto Ball Creek Rd and go 2.6
    * Keep L on Ball Creek Rd and go 4
    * Merge w/Coweeta Lab Rd and go 3.2
    * Arrive at US-441


####Trail Guide

* **Duration**: 0.4, 0:20 up, 0:15 down
* **Navigation**
    * Head through the bald area to SW of parking.
    * Then bushwhack to summit. It is a mid-level bushwhack in the dead season.  It might be tough in the green season.
    * USGS Quad is Prentiss
    * Notes:
        * Hurricane Cr Loop horse trail #36 is to the right of the field.
        * Gate at the field is marked "RD 7217"
        * Albert Mtn is the peak across the road from the field.  It has a nice fire tower, but it isn't a SOTA summit.
