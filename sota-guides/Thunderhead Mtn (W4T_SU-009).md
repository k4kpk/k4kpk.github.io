####Pre-planning notes:

* N4SR says: 
    * Well my son and I took Lead Cove trail, which is shorter by about 1 mile round trip [than from Anthony Creek in Cades Cove]. Surprises, once you are on the AT, the net climb over 1.6 miles is about 600 feet. However it is a camel's back. Up 300 ft, down 200 ft until you reach the summit. There is a marker at the top. But look at it then head back down to the bald and activate there.
    * It is a long hike, about 12 miles round trip but well worth it. Pick a nice day and leave early and you can do it!
