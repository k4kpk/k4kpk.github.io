# SOTA Guide - Greentop, W4T/SU-076

#### I do not like Greentop.  I do not intend to activate it again.  

* It is difficult to find a safe spot for an HF antenna, avoiding power lines.
* I was able to raise Knoxville (strong signal report) on VHF with a Yagi, but I found only 2 VHF contacts with calling on 146.52 and zero chasers after spotting.
* S5 noise level on 20 and 40 meters in 2015.  (S3 in 2014.)
* No opportunity to set up away from noise sources.
* I got blisters from poison ivy on the summit.

#### Summit Guide

* Hang antenna from tree: No
* Space to guy mast: No
* Cell coverage: AT&T (VZN and APRS not tested)
* Unique features: Summit is full of towers and power lines.  The only wire antenna I could fit was to run a near-vertical sloper off the side of the fire tower or to throw a line over a tree in the "corner" (above poison ivy).  Any place else near the summit was just too close to a power line or an air conditioning noise source.
