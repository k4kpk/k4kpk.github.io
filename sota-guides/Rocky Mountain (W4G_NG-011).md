#### Drive to Trailhead & Trail Guide - Rocky Mtn (W4G/NG-011)

There are 2 routes to Indian Grave Gap:

- Indian Grave Gap Road - this has a shallow creek ford. The creek bed is lined with fist-sized rocks. I've never had a problem crossing it with my Corolla, but it is always scary because I can't really see what the creek bed looks like. The road itself is always in very good condition for a forest service dirt road.
- Tray Mountain Road - Tray Mountain Road from GA-75 to Indian Grave Gap Road. In 2020, this had scary erosion gullies and a huge mud wallow.  I had to leave the road and drive between trees to get around it. There is a metal towing company sign nailed to a tree by the mud wallow!  Note that this is Tray Mountain Road *before* reaching Indian Grave Gap road.  (The stretch of Tray Mountain Road from Indian Grave Gap Road to Tray Gap is *different* problem stretch.)

Note: Shorter hike and less climb from the Indian Grave Gap trailhead.

NOTE: **Do not drive through Helen!**
