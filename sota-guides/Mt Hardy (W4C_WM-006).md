#### Drive Guide - Black Balsam to Mt Hardy (Mt Hardy Gap Trailhead)

- Head back to BRP on Black Balsam Knob Rd.  R on BRP and go 4.0

#### Trail Guide - Mt Hardy Gap to Summit

- **Duration**: 1:10 up; 0:55 down; 0.9 miles
- **Navigation**
  - Even with GPS, I lost the trail several times. If you aren't sure where to go, look to your left about 15' uphill to find the trail continuing in the same direction.
  - The trailhead is 10' (compass) north of the end of the paved drainage ditch. There's a tree with a leaning lower trunk and a fork above the lean to mark the spot.
  - Park 50' (compass) north of the end of the paved drainage ditch. There's a grassy shoulder large enough for 1-2 small cars.
  - This is a tough route. If I want to reach the summit in 1:10, I'd prefer to jog the Buckeye Gap route rather than do this one again!
- **GPS Failure recovery**: Head compass south until you reach BRP. The terrain is rough. If you lose GPS, you're in trouble.
- **Trailhead altitude** (Mt Hardy Gap): 5520' @ parking 35.2994,-82.92559
- **Summit altitude**: 6140' @ 35.3031, -82.9276
- **GPS tracks/waypoints**: Follow GPS trace.

#### Trail Guide - Buckeye Gap to Summit

* **Duration**: 1:40 up; 1:15 down; 2.2 miles
* **Navigation**
    * Caution: Even with a GPS and an accurate trace, I made two wrong turns.
    * Trail is too wet for sneakers; need dry hiking boots.
    * The trailhead is across the street from one end of the parking. 
        * Compass north end of the lot.  Parkway mileposts say it is southern end of lot because the northbound parkway heads south here.
    * After a few hundred yards, note the metal posts.  When you return, retrace your route; there's a risk you'll wander off to the right.
    * At 1.3 miles (about 0:40 for me), there is a steep, vague trail climbing up to your right.  Take this trail.  (I missed it, and went along the level trail.)
* **Trailhead altitude** (Buckeye Gap): 5300' @ parking lot @ 35.3041900, -82.9422550
* **Trailhead altitude** (Mt Hardy Gap): 5520' @ parking @ 35.29949,-82.92544
* **Summit altitude**: 6140' @ 35.3031, -82.9276
* **GPS tracks/waypoints**:
    * 35.3087,-82.92525 = Intersection with route from NC-215 (Buckeye Gap route)
    * 35.30589,-82.92599 = Intersection of Mt Hardy Gap trail with other routes.
