####Trail Guide

* **Duration**: 1:40 up; 1:15 down; 2.2 miles
* **Navigation**
    * You will need a GPS to follow the route.  Even with a GPS and an accurate trace, I made two wrong turns.
    * Trail is too wet for sneakers; need dry hiking boots.
    * The trailhead is across the street from one end of the parking. 
        * The compass says it is the north end of the lot.  Parkway mileposts say it is the southern end of the lot because the northbound parkway heads south here.
    * After a few hundred yards, note the metal posts.  When you return, you need to retrace your route, and there's a risk you'll wander off to the right.
    * At 1.3 miles (about 0:40 for me), there is a steep, vague trail climbing up to your right.  Take this trail.  (I missed it, and went an extra 0.6 on the level trail.)
* **Trailhead altitude**: 5300' @ parking lot @ 35.3041900, -82.9422550
* **Summit altitude**: 6140'
* **GPS tracks/waypoints**:
    * 35.3087,-82.92525 = Intersection with route from NC-215
