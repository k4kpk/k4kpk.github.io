#### Summit Guide

* Hang antenna from tree: Yes
* Space to guy mast: Yes
* Cell coverage: AT&T=yes in 2024, APRS=yes in 2024
    * Approaching the summit, there is a fenced shack with a narrow tower on your right, just before the open area.  Call the micro-clearing near the fence corner "shack."
    * Entering the clearing at the summit, there is a small grassy area to sit, on your right. Call this area "parking space."
    * APRS went out fine from parking space and from shack. I sent APRS to email from:
        * shack, sitting at parking space, and standing at parking space.

    * APRS has *lots* of activity, so you must wait for a pause to transmit.
    * Cell voice worked and cell data worked VERY SLOWLY, but only from certain locations.
        * VERY small area half-way between parking space and shack. I wandered slowly between parking space and shack and found a data and SMS spot.
        * SMS was a little easier, but I still had to wander to find success.
        * I did NOT try cell right next to the microwave towers.

* Lots of radios and antennas on summit. There is a report that you may not be able to do a 2M activation due to QRM.
