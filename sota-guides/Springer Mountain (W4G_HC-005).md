    * Bear L onto USFS-77 and go 4.9  (This doesn't quite match Google in 2014.)
    * L on dirt road and go 2.6 (I *think* this is USFS-42).
    * Parking lot on R.  Lot frequently full by mid-morning on weekends/holidays.
    * Note: USFS-77 had some moderate mud spots, erosion down to rough rocks, and deep ruts. But Appalachian Blue Ridge and Winding Stair Gap Rd north of Deerlick Gap was a muddy morass.  I drove it downhill on my way to Sassafras Mtn, and I don't think I could have driven it uphill.
