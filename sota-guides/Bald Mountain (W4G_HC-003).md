#### Trail Guide

* **Duration**: 0:30 up, 0:15 down; 0.5 miles
* **Navigation**
    * Follow the trail 0.5 miles. Starts northeast, then east, then northeast again.
    * The trail is basically straight up the mountain, with no descent.  It goes up, but it is probably the easiest of the Georgia 10-pointers, given the modest slope and short distance.  The actual summit is off the trail about 75' and is covered with evergreens, but the trail passes through the activation zone.
    * In summer, the trail and the summit are overgrown with greenery.  Bluejeans are advised, due to thorns crowing the trail.
* **Trailhead altitude**: 3621' @ Trailhead @ 34.86117, -84.63482
* **Summit altitude**: 4005'
* **GPS tracks/waypoints**:
    * Trailhead: 34.86117, -84.63482
    * Summit: 34.86450, -84.62830

#### Summit Guide

* Hang antenna from tree: Yes.
* Space to guy mast: Challenging in spring/summer, due to underbrush.
* Cell coverage: Verizon SMS, AT&T SMS (intermittent), and APRS -- all worked.
* Note that there are flush toilets at the picnic area at Lake Conasauga.  You have to pay $2 to park there, and don't forget that the picnic area isn't open for the full March-December season that the road is open.

#### Plan-B Candidates
