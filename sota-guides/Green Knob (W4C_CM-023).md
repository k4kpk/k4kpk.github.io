        * Trailhead is marked by a small, foot tall concrete post, in a grassy shoulder big enough to park 2-3 cars.
        * CAUTION: There's a post on the other side of the road about 100' away.  Make sure you are on the correct side of the road. (Nominally the west side; geographically the north side.)
