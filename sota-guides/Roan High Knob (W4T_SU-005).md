#### Trail Guide from Cloudland (short route)

* **Duration**: 0.8 miles, 250' climb
    * After 2 other summits: 0:30 up, 0:20 down (in 2014)
    * After 1 other summit and not exhausted: 0:20 up, 0:20 down (in 2015)
* **Note**: Flush toilets and a water fountain at trailhead.
* **Navigation**
    * If you follow the trail at the restroom end of the parking lot, you'll come to the AT, where you turn R.  There is a surprising amount of descent before the trail turns up.  This descent is heavily eroded.
        * To avoid the eroded part, you can walk back down the paved road.  After a few hundred yards, you'll pass a gated road on your R.  There will be some big rock on your L and a faint trail.  This trail runs about 100' to the AT, where you can turn R.  I took this route (in reverse, when I hiked out on 9/27/2014.)
    * At restroom end of parking lot, take connector trail to AT.
    * R on AT.
    * After you've been climbing for a while, when you're beside the summit (or just a little past), the trail will turn slightly down.  This is where you'll find the blue blazed trail to the shelter and the summit.
* **Trailhead altitude**: ??? @ 36.10397, -82.13317
* **Summit altitude**: 6285 @ 36.1046, -82.1224

#### Trail Guide from Carvers Gap (long route)

* **Duration**: 1.6 miles, 1:30 up via creek, 0:50 down via NC-1348, 800' climb (2nd summit of the day)
* **Navigation**
    * Option 1: Walk north (into Tennessee) to the end of the on-road parking. Turn L at double-blaze onto AT.  This descends to a creek and then climbs through a series of switchback to the blue-blazed turn-off on the L to the summit + shelter.
    * Option 2: Walk up NC-1348 past the gate about 1/10th mile. Look for a graveled trail on the R, with a vertical post blocking vehicles.  This will join up with the AT in about 1/10th mile at the first major switchback.  It isn't as pleasant as option 1, but it saves you the descent to and climb from the creek.
* **Trailhead altitude**: 5510 @ 36.1064, -82.1104
* **Summit altitude**: 6285 @ 36.1046, -82.1224
