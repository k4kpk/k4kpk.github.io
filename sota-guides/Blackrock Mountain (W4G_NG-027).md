* **Duration**: 0:30 (0.6 miles); 0:20 down.  This is for the true summit.  ~0:05 less to Tennessee Rock.
* **Navigation**
    * Trailhead at Tennessee Rock Trail parking.  Trailhead is through the picnic area, past the pay-to-park post.
	* Within the first 5 minutes, take both left forks.
    * It is a loop trail. The left side is 2/3 the length of the right.  Right side may be nice if you have extra time, but left side is what I document.

####Summit Guide

* Activate from Tennessee Rock: There is a long, narrow ridge at the summit.  
    * The activation zone clearly includes Tennessee Rock Overlook, as well as the proper summit. 
    * I checked it twice with an altimeter and the low point between Tennessee Rock and the formal summit is about 40' below the summit. 
    * The view is prettier from Tennessee Rock and I chose to operate from Tennessee Rock because it was convenient to bungee my mast to the wooden railing.
* Hang antenna from tree: Possible.
* Space to guy mast: Easy to bungee-cord a mast to the wooden railing.
* 2013 cell Tennessee Rock: Good VZN; no AT&T; good APRS.
* 2014 cell from true summit: AT&T=OK.
* 2015 cell from Tennessee Rock: Good AT&T.
