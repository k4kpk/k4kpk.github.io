Buzzard Knob: Drive to Trailhead & Trail Guide
--------------------------------------------------------
#### Drive Guide - Buzzard Knob via Blue Ridge Gap

* **Duration**: 2:10 Estimated.
* **Google Maps** URL from Atlanta (33.917, -84.3378): https://goo.gl/maps/yRzXq7qJRrG2
* **Seasonal/Limited Access**: Last bit is steep, dirt road.  Impassible in 2014; re-graded in 2015.
* **Directions**:
    * Take a good street-capable GPS and pre-load maps, if necessary.  You'll want it for your final approach, where Google Maps and reality diverge.
    * N on GA-400 and go 47 miles.
    * At end of 400 (@ GA-60) go straight onto GA-115. Go 4.8
    * GA-115 turns R.  Go 11.4.
    * L on Tesnatee Gap Valley Rd. There's a left turn lane.  Go 2.8.
    * Go straight onto McAfee Rd. (Tesnatee turns left.)  Go 0.2
    * L on US-129 N at T.  Go 0.8.
    * R on GA-75A. Go 8.2.
    * L on GA-75 and go 16.6
    * Stop -- Make sure all of your GPS are turned on and you're tracking your route.
    * R on GA-2/US-76E and go 5.2.
    * The final approach to the trailhead (about 15 minutes):
        * L on Upper Hightower Rd (sign to Mt Pleasant Church of God) and go 1.6
        * Upper Hightower Rd makes a 90 degree left turn; follow it. Go 1.6.
        * Road becomes 1 lane and loses the center stripe.  About this point, it forks, and the left fork is Jack Branch Rd.  Stay to the right.  Go 0.2.
        * There is a gravel road to the right. Do NOT take it.  Go 0.2.
        * Fork to left is marked private. Keep right.  Go 0.1.
        * If the road is too rough to continue, park at wide spot in road.  Room for 3-4 cars.  There's a buried-fiber-optic post marking the spot.
        * Otherwise, continue 0.8 miles to the AT.  
    * In 2014, there were 2-foot deep erosion gullies which could tip a Jeep and had been observed to break a truck frame. 
        * Be prepared to back out, if necessary.
* **Food**
    * Last McDonalds: GA-53 on GA-400.
        * There is a McDonalds in Hiawasee that opens at 6 AM 7 days a week, but it is out of your way.

* **Notes**
    * If you can't reach Blue Ridge Gap, you can safely get a Prius as far as 34.95928,-83.60615.  This adds 0.8 miles and 560' of climb to your hike (one-way).

#### Trail Guide

* **Durations: 2.6 miles; 1:55 up, 1:30 down. (Estimated)

* **Navigation**
    * Head south (to your right, as you drive up Charlies Creek rd) on the AT for 2.6 miles.
    * The trip begins with an 0.6 mile 400' climb up As Knob.
    * Then you descend As Knob for about 3/4 mile to Plumorchard Gap Shelter.
    * Then you make a 1/2 mile climb to an unnamed gap.
    * There's 1/2 mile of minor up and down.
    * Ending with an 0.2 mile, 300' climb from Bull Gap to the high point of the trail near Buzzard Knob.
    * Heading back to the car, there's a little climb after the initial drop, and the only other real climb is the 150' ascent up As Knob near the end, so you can hustle.

* **Trailhead altitude**: Blue Ridge Gap = 3035'
* **Summit altitude**: 3740'
* **GPS tracks/waypoints**:
    * Buzzard Knob: 34.9335,-83.6025
    * Blue Ridge Gap Trailhead: 34.95871,-83.59633
    * Prius Parking: 34.95928,-83.60615

#### Summit Guide

* The high point on the trail is definitely within the activation zone.  I have measured 34.93261,-83.60191 as being 80-90 feet down from the summit, and the trail high point is well above that.
* The summit is nothing special.  Activate anywhere convenient within the zone.
* Hang antenna from tree: Heavy vegetation makes it challenging.
* Space to guy mast: Heavy vegetation makes it challenging.
* 2013 Cell coverage: Good. AT&T had 3G internet. VZN SMS good. No APRS msgs or beacons worked.
