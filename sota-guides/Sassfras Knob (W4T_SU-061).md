#### Drive Guide - Ducktown to Trailhead
* **Caution**: If Google Maps sends you on Campbell Cove Creek Rd, it is sending you onto two minor ruts across a field, which quickly develop erosion gullies so severe that you cannot get a passenger sedan through.  I think you'd need pretty serious 4WD to make it through that route.
* **Caution**: Kimsey Mtn Hwy is barely drivable in a passenger sedan.  Road is eroded around big rocks, with some big erosion gullies.
* L on GA-60/TN-68 at the T.  Go 8 miles
* At Vics Auto Parts, sharp L onto ironically named Kimsey Mtn Hwy (dirt road) and go 5.4
* Road turns sharp L and the gate is on the inside of the turn.  Parking space for 2 vehicles.
