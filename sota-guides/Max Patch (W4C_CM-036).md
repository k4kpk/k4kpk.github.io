# SOTA Guide - Max Patch W4C/CM-036

Parking is a problem.  At 9:05 AM on a clear Saturday, I took the last space in the lot. By 10:45 the lot was full and the road was crowded with cars parked on the shoulder. On a clear Friday in December, the lot was full by noon and most of the road parking was full.  About 0.6 before you reach the Max Patch lot, there is a gravel road with on your left.  You could park 1-2 cars here without blocking the gate; more with, and the gate clearly hasn't been open in a while.
