#### Trail Guide

* **Duration**:
    * Option 0 = 0.3, 350'.  0:15 up and 0:10 down. "Center trail."
    * Option 1 = 0.3, 350'. 0:20 up and 0:10 down (respectful overland route);
    * Option 2 = 0.6, 350'. 0:30 up and 0:20 down (trail to the left, from parking lot)
    * Option 3 = 0.9, 350'. 0:30 up and 0:20 down (trail to right, from parking lot, to AT where you turn L)
    * If you take a trail, the trail to the L is nicer than the trail to the R.
* **Navigation** (I have GPX traces of both routes. Contact me, if you want them.)
    * At the end of the lot away from the road, there's a 3-way trail fork (NE, E, SE).
    * The "center route" (direct to the summit) was 'permanently closed' due to vandalism. It is no longer marked as closed in August of 2017.
