# SOTA Guide - Max Patch W4C/CM-036

Parking is a problem.  Feasible roadside parking is often full.  About 0.6 south (left out of the lot) is a gravel road on the west side.  You could park 1-2 cars here without blocking the gate; more with; the gate clearly hasn't been open in a while.

Warning: I-40 closed until summer 2022: https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/nfsnc/alerts-notices/?aid=70284
