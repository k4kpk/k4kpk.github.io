#### Summit Guide

* Hang antenna from tree: Y
* Space to guy mast: Y
* Cell coverage: VZN=bars but SMS failed; AT&T=bars but SMS not tested; APRS=Y
* Unique features: 
    * There is a solar-powered communications tower on top.  
    * Topo maps indicate there is a fire tower, but the fire tower was dismantled.  
    * It looks like there were power lines up to the fire tower, but when they tore the tower down, the lines were deactivated, so the comm tower is powered by solar panels on its roof.
    * No views due to tree growth.
