    * Sharp R and gate.
        * Park just after the hairpin turn, well before the gate.  Room for 2 cars.
        * There's a lesser, gated road, if you don't make the sharp R. This does not lead to the summit.

#### Summit Guide

* Don't drive past the gate if it is open.  It has a "No parking beyond the gate" sign.  I have seen a maintenance truck leave the gate open on his way up and lock it on the way down.  He did not check with a group who had driven to the summit before he left.  You could get locked in.
* Hang antenna from tree: No.  All trees have been cleared.
* Space to guy mast: Yes.
* Cell coverage: ATT=yes, Vzn=adequate, Patrick says APRS=yes (but no tracking)
* Unique features:
    * Helipad, fire tower, and building at summit.  Also cell towers.
