Buckeye Knob: Drive to Trailhead & Trail Guide
--------------------------------------------------------
#### Drive Guide - Buckeye Knob from Atlanta

* **Duration**: 1:45
* **Google Maps** URL from Atlanta (33.91998, -84.33898): 
    * Atlanta, Buckeye, Akin, Atlanta (Double-header): http://goo.gl/maps/0XZ0E
    * ... plus dinner: http://goo.gl/maps/cR97o
* **Seasonal/Limited Access**: All-season, dirt. Patrick drove it in February. May require SUV.
* **Directions**:
    * GA-400 N for 47
    * L on US-19 and go 5.1 
    * R on GA-9 N - go 8 miles.
    * L on GA-60 - go 7.3.
        * This is more of a Y than a left turn. It is near the entrance to the R Ranch resort community.
    * R on GA-180 (Wolf Pen Gap Rd) - go 7.7
    * L on Duncan Ridge Rd - go 3.9. (a.k.a. Forest Service road FS 39.)
        * Duncan Ridge Rd Landmarks, where Duncan Ridge Rd meets GA-180:
        * "Wolf Pen Gap" highway sign (green background, white letters) on the right.
        * On the left, the dirt road has a big "Coopers Creek WMA" sign.
        * There's a green-blazed trail on the right side of 180. I suspect it is the Coosa trail (which does not go to Coosa Bald).
    * Park at campsite/wide spot in road on L, just past Duncan Ridge Trail (trailhead) on R.
