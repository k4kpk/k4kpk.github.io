Trip-specific: Drive to Trailhead & Trail Guide
--------------------------------------------------------
#### Drive Guide - Rock Mountain

* Garmin shows Courthouse Gap Rd as getting close to Rock Mountain, but Google Maps says this road is much shorter.  I found a "Private Road" sign on it at N34.91567 W83.35029.  I don't think you can get to the Courthouse Gap Trailhead at N34.91567 W83.35029 unless you find the owner of the private part of the road.

* Alternate trailhead at N34.90724 W83.33531 at the end of Finney Creek Rd has a longer bushwhack.  After turning off the paved Warwoman Rd, the road turns to twin-track, so drivability in 2WD is doubtful.
