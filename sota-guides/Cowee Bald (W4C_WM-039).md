#### Trail Guide

* **Duration**: 0:15, 0.5 mile to the summit
* **Navigation**
    * There's an always-closed gate on the road to the summit.  You'll park within sight (less than 100') of the gate, at an obvious wide spot in the road. I measured the altitude at the parking area as about 145' vertically below the summit.  If the activation zone is 75', you only need to climb 70' vertically.
    * There is very bad QRM (loud buzzing, S7-S8) on all HF bands at the summit.It was so bad I almost abandoned my activation attempt.  Once you reach the summit, you really can't get far enough away from the towers to mitigate the QRM.  I recommend setting up your antenna **well before** the cell towers come into sight.
    * You reach the edge of the activation zone at 35.33091,-83.33897, 0.15 miles after the parking area.
    * At 35.32995,-83.33716 (0.27 miles after the parking lot) you are about 23' below the summit and you have done almost all of your steep climbing.  (i.e. It was "steep" up to this point and it is a more gentle climb after this point.)
    * If you can find a good spot between 35.33091,-83.33897 and 35.32995,-83.33716, that will certainly be better than setting up near the fire tower.
* **Trailhead altitude**: 4810 at parking
* **Summit altitude**: 4944
* **GPS tracks/waypoints**:
    * Parking: 35.33255,-83.34038 (wide spot in road, within sight of locked gate, within 100' of the gate)
    * Near edge of 75' activation zone: 35.33091,-83.33897
    * End of steep climb, 23' below the high point: 35.32995,-83.33716
    * Summit: 35.3265, -83.3351

#### Summit Guide

* Hang antenna from tree: Yes
* Space to guy mast: Yes
* Cell coverage: Yes
* Unique features:
    * Fire tower and cell towers
    * Very high QRM (buzzing, S7-S8) on all HF bands at the summit.
    * I was only able to raise one FM contact, even with spotting 146.55 and also calling on 146.52.

#### Plan-B Candidates

* You literally drive right past the Shepherd Bald (W4C/WM-045) trailhead at 35.32478,-83.37609.
