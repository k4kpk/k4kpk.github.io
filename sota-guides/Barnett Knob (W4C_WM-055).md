Drive to Trailhead & Trail Guide - Barnett Knob
--------------------------------------------------------
#### Drive Guide - Barnett Knob from Atlanta

Note: This looks to be just outside parkway land, on Cherokee territory.

* **Duration**: 2:50
* **Google Maps** URL from Atlanta (33.91998, -84.33898): https://goo.gl/maps/8ggQXCn7TCr
    * WARNING: Google does not know that the Blue Ridge Parkway is limited access.  When the parkway has an overpass over a BIA dirt road, Google may think it is an intersection.  (E.g. BIA 413 a.k.a. Dobson Ridge Rd.)  If the road is closed through Cherokee, follow US-19 east from Cherokee all the way to its intersection with the parkway (about a 15-minute detour).
    * Note: There's a river through Cherokee, NC. Google will route you up the east side of the river.  441 runs up the west side of the river.  They are about the same at 7 AM, but if the tourists are out, 441 may be slooow.
* **Seasonal/Limited Access**: The Blue Ridge Parkway is closed in snowy weather. Check the [BRP Closure Map](http://go.nps.gov/blri-roads).
* **Directions**:
 * I-285 to I-85 North.
 * I-985 and US-23 to Clayton.
 * Follow US-441 from Clayton to Cherokee.
 * Left on US-441 in Cherokee, to parallel the river and go 2.8.
 * Right onto Blue Ridge Parkway and go 6.8.
 * Look for a gated road to your right.
   * Note: If you're headed toward Cherokee, look for a gated road on your left at 35.52482,-83.22941
   * BRP MM 462.5
* **Food**
    * Last McDonalds: Cherokee
