#### Trail Guide

    * Follow the road until you reach a turn-around (circle/parking lot) near the top.
    * There's a gated road at the far side of the turn-around from where you enter.  Don't take it.
    * To your right, there is a deeply cut trail/road blocked by two big dirt piles.  Follow this route about 10 minutes.
