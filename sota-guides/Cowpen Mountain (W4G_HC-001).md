#### Drive Guide - Cowpen from Dyer Cemetery
* Drive south (toward 64A side road to Flat Top) on USFS-64 for 5.1 miles.  Parking on right, just as road makes sharp left.  Parking is just over the crest of a rise; you can't see it until you're right by it.

#### Trail Guide

* **Duration**: 
    * Flat route: 1:30  (1.7 miles; 635 ft climb). 0:40 descent
    * Short route: 0:50 (1.3 miles; 635 ft climb).  0:40 descent (0:25 if you run)
* **Navigation**
    * Trail is FT-30.  East Cowpen Trail, heading north.
    * At 0.4 miles, FT-12 (Rough Ridge) branches to right, and is NOT our trail.
    * From this point, the ridge crest will be to your left.
    * **Short Route**
        * At 34.89306, -84.57474, there is a draw to your left.  Follow it up to the ridge.
        * Once you reach the ridge you are in the activation zone.
        * If desired, turn left and follow the ridge to the high point; if you do, foliage is less dense on the near (east) edge of the ridge.  Summit is indistinct.
    * **Flat Route**
        * At about 1.3 miles, sharp turn to left, heading south, is final approach to summit.
        * You have hiked PAST the summit, to a gap.  Now you bushwhack up the ridge crest to the summit.  Not a tough bushwhack in early March, except there are some briars.  It might be worse in the green season.
        * Summit at 1.7 miles.  Summit is indistinct.
