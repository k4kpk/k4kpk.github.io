#### Summit Guide

* Hang antenna from tree: No suitable trees.
* Space to guy mast: 
    * You can't guy a mast, but there are plenty of places to bungee the base of a mast.
    * Take full advantage of the 75' (vertical) activation zone in order to get out of the heavy  pedestrian traffic.
    * There's a fence on the south side, near the trail, protecting rare flora. It could be used to support a vertical.
    * I found a dwarf tree, a little north of the summit, and bungee corded a 31' fiberglass mast to it.
* Cell coverage: Adequate.
* Unique features:
    * Views.  
    * Confederate carving on the face of the mountain.
    * Suppose you have a less-mobile family member.  You can put them on the tram at the bottom of the mountain, then you climb to the top and meet them there.  Then they can observe you operating.
