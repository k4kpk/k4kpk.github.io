Trip-specific: Drive to Trailhead & Trail Guide
--------------------------------------------------------
#### Drive Guide - Oakey Mountain via Rock Mtn


* This is NOT the normal route to Oakey. It makes Oakey a side trip from Rock Mtn (W4G/NG-024)
* I do NOT recommend this route.  The bushwhack is pretty intense.
* **Duration**: 2:15
* **Google Maps** URL from Ashford Dunwoody Rd and I-285 at 33.92,-84.339: https://tinyurl.com/rock-mtn-sarah2
* **Seasonal/Limited Access**:
    * Rutted dirt road. 4WD recommended.
* **Directions** (practical route, 4WD recommended):
    * I-285 to I-85 N, and go 17
    * I-985 N / US-23 N, and go 53
    * L on US-441 / US-23 N and go 22.9
    * R on Rickman (Wendy's & Burger King) and go 0.5
    * R on Warwomand Dr and go 8.6
    * L on Sarah's Creek Rd and go 1.9 to Sarah's Creek Campground
    * Continue 0.2 through the campground, then keep Left at intersection.
    * Continue 6.8 and park.
    * Note: If your vehicle can handle the road, you can drive to 34.938, -83.335 and reduce your walk.
* **Alternate Route** (4WD required): [This page](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/georgia/bartram-trail-wilson-gap-to-rabun-bald) says you can get there via
    - Take Warwoman Rd out of Clayton. Left at Tuckaluge Creek Rd. Bear right onto Dan Gap Rd (155). Left onto Wilson Gap Rd. You'll see a Dead End sign. Continue to trail head.
    -  Paraphrased:
      - Rickman Dr east from Clayton and go 0.5
      - R on Warwoman Rd and go 5.7
      - L on Tuckaluge Creek Rd (at 34.8933, -83.2927) and go 0.7
      - Keep R and go 1.5
      - Bear R on Dan Gap Rd (FS-155E), leaving Tuckaluge Creek Rd and go 2.5 
      - Turn left onto Wilson Gap Rd (FS-155) and go 1.3 (before ruts) or 2 (after ruts).
      - Google Maps knows this route, except a segment from 34.9016,-83.3002 to 34.9136,-83.308. 
* **Food**
    * Last McDonalds: Clayton.  Poor service on weekends.
    * Penultimate McDonalds: Just before Cornelia, on Level Grove Rd.
