# SOTA Guide - Bunches Bald, W4C/CM-013

Note: This is on the Cherokee reservation.  Ask permission at the campground, it is open May 15 - Oct 15.

**ALERT**: There is a [2017 report](https://www.sota.org.uk/Article/W4C/WM-013/21367) that they are now hostile to summit hikers. I recommend against sneaking up in the off season.  I've heard Cherokee courts are unsympathetic to trespassers.  In 2015, when I activated, I asked at the camp office and they said, "Sure.  Go ahead."

#### Drive Guide - Heintooga Rd to Bunches Bald

* Best route:
    * Go 1 mile on Heintooga past
    * L onto unnamed dirt road at at sign for Mile High Campground and go 0.3.
    * At 5-way intersection:
        * Do not take the acute L (downhill).  This is BIA 407 back to Heintooga.
        * Do not take the acute R.  This leads into campsites.
        * 90-degree left turn leads to office (slight uphill).  There are signs when the camp is open. Go there and ask permission.
        * 90-degree right turn (passing between green shed and shower building) leads to trailhead.  Park in the grass strip (inside the hairpin) where road makes hairpin turn L.  
          There's a gate on the path to the summit (not across BIA 407).

* Poor route - Immediately after turning onto Heintooga, bear L on twisty dirt road (BIA 407) up to campground.

The 5-way intersection in the middle of the camp:

* There's a speed bump on the driveway back to Heintooga.
* There's a sign as you come into camp that says to drive slow.  On the back of this sign (visible from mid-intersection), there's hand-lettered "Exit" on the left side of the sign and a wiggly line on the right side.  This tells you that the road to the left is the driveway back to Heintooga, and the road to the right is the twisty-windy BIA 407 leg back to Heintooga.
* There's a speed bump on the leg of BIA 407 that leads to the trailhead.  (This is the road between the green shed and the shower building.)

        * Walk up this road past a tent campsite.
        * Just before a pressed-metal gate (with a hand-lettered "Employees Only" sign), there's a dirt trail up and to your right, leading into the last campsite.
        * Walk into the last campsite (post is marked T4).  Apologize to the campers.
