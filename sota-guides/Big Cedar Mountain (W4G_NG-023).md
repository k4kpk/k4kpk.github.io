####Drive Guide - Big Cedar (W4G/NG-023) and Black Mountain (W4G/NG-022)

Note: Big Cedar is NG-023; Black Mountain is NG-022.  This is confusing (but true).  Normally the lower-numbered summit is taller, but Big Cedar is taller and 10 points and Black Mountain is 8 points, but Big Cedar is NG-023 and Black Mountain is NG-022.
