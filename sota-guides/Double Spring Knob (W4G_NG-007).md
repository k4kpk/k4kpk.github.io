Double Spring Knob + Round Top: Drive to Trailhead & Trail Guide
--------------------------------------------------------
##### Combined Double Spring Knob and Round Top Activation

#### Drive Guide

* **Duration**: 2:30 from Atlanta
* **Google Maps** URL from I-285 at 33.91819, -84.33747: http://goo.gl/maps/QQRl2
* **Seasonal/Limited Access**: Dirt road.  I saw open gates on 2012.12.30.  Patrick did not report closed gates on 2013.02.27.  FS map does not show it as seasonal.
* **Directions**:
    * CAREFUL: The default Google Maps route got the penultimate bits WRONG!  
        * My URL above avoids the wrong bit.  
        * Do NOT turn left on Verner Kastner.  It is a private driveway.
    * About 2:30 from Atlanta
    * I-85 north to I-985 / GA-365 north.
    * Travel 45.1 miles total on 985/365.
    * At Cornelia, take GA-105 / US-441 Historical north (left). Go 0.7.
    * Left on GA-105. Go 8.5.

        * This road is on your left, just past volunteer fire station. 
        * Street sign with the road name, FS sign for the area, and FS sign for campgrounds.
        * Drove it in my 2006 Corolla. Some spots where any erosion will be a problem.
        * Gate at 0.9 miles (34.8329, -83.5966?). It was open on December 30, 2012.
            * "Forest Service Roads, Chattahoochee-Oconee" shows 26-2 as closed Jan 1-Feb 29, but 26-1 has no close date, nor is shaded as seasonal road.
        * Gate at 7.7, one mile short of Addis Gap is always closed. (This is marked as a seasonal road on USFS map.) Parking for 3-4 cars near the gate.

        * It comes just BEFORE Cornelia and your exit to US-441.
        * It is before Cornelia on Level Grove Rd.
    * Penultimate McDonalds: 
        * 3183 Frontage Rd, Gainesville.  GA-53 / Mundy Mill Rd exit.

####Trail Guide

* **Duration**: TOTAL = 5:15
    * 1:45 from parking to Double Spring Knob
    * 1:00 from Double Spring Knob back to Addis Gap
    * 0:15 rest stop in Addis Gap
    * 1:00 from Addis Gap to Round Top
    * 1:00 from Round Top back to parking
* Significant bushwhacking - Carry a GPS.

* **Navigation (parking to Double Spring)**:
    * There's a gate on Wildcat Road, about a mile from the AT. You may read about another gate. Its remains are about half way between the 1-mile gate and Addis Gap.
Walk past the gate and up the road.
    * When you come to a T, take the trail to your left. It is marked with a forest service iron post with a diamond on it.
    * Addis Gap is well marked. It is clearly a gap. The dirt road you enter on crests and continues forward and down. AT goes left and right. Turn R for the Double Spring Knob.
    * As you near the summit, the trail crosses over the ridge and starts to descend. You don't descend.
    * In Dec. 2012, there was a snow plus ice layer on everything.  I bushwhacked from the trail to the summit.  Briars were a problem.
    * There is a faint manway parts of the way to the summit when not obscured by snow.

* **Navigation (Double Spring to Round Top)**:
    * Backtrack to Addis Gap.
    * Continue through Addis Gap on AT.
    * As you near the summit, the trail curves around the end of the ridge. It is about 45 minutes from Addis Gap. 
    * Bushwhack to summit.
    
* **Trailhead altitude**: 3050' at gate @ 	34.86298, -83.64907
* **Summit altitude**: Double Spring =4300' ; Round Top = 3964'
* **GPS tracks/waypoints**:
    * Trailhead at the gate = 34.86298, -83.64907
    * Trail/road junction. Turn LEFT = 34.86698, -83.65280
    * Addis Gap and the Appalachian Trail = 34.86317, -83.65616
    * Begin Double Spring bushwhack = 34.87587, -83.65467
        * Note: I returned to the AT at 34.87749, -83.65464. Less brush via this route, but steep climb.
    * Round Top bushwhack begins = 34.84812, -83.66028
        * Note: I returned to the AT at 34.84834, -83.66022. This would be an OK point to depart the AT.

####Summit Guide: Double Spring Knob

* Hang antenna from tree: Dense, scrubby trees made it tough.
* Space to guy mast: I recommend carrying a mast and using bungee cords or velcro to bind it to a tree stump.
* Cell coverage:
    * AT&T = intermittent; Vzn = Unknown; APRS = Unknown.
    * You SHOULD be able to get off an SMS to self-spot.
* Unique features:  No view.

####Summit Guide: Round Top

* Hang antenna from tree: Yes.  No problem.
* Space to guy mast: Yes.  No problem.
* Cell coverage: AT&T = good; Vzn = Unknown; APRS = Unknown
* Unique features: No view.

####Plan-B Candidates

* You should have a Plan-B for this one.  There are some spots in the road that will wash out if not maintained soon; if you go in winter, be sure to check on the status of those gates.
* Little Bald Knob?
* Tray Mountain?
* The OTHER Round Top (W4G/NG-030)?
* Levelland
