#### Summit Guide

* Hang antenna from tree:
* Space to guy mast:
* Cell coverage:
* Unique features:
    * TV transmitter on summit.  Awful QRM, loud enough to de-sense my receiver to the point where I had to increase audio gain by 50%.  40m unusable due to QRM.  20m marginally usable. LOTS of No Trespassing signs near the summit, so I activated from the side of the road.
    * Drive-up summit.  Easy to park near top and walk out/into the activation zone.
