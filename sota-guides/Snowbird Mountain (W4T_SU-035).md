#### Drive Guide - Snowbird Mountain from Walnut Mountain (Rattlesnake Gap)

- **Duration**: 1:20, ? miles
- **Google Maps** URL : 
- **Seasonal/Limited Access**: Google knows a more direct route, but it is tough to follow and it took 1:35 when Google claimed 1:00.
- **Directions**:
  - South on Wolf Creek Rd (back the way you came in) and go 1.6
  - L on Round Mtn Rd and 1.1.

#### Drive Guide - Snowbird Mountain from I-40 West

- R on Green Corner Rd and go 3.4
- L on Green Corner Rd and go 0.4
- R on Grassy Fork Rd and go 3.1  (turns to dirt at 1.3)
  - Too steep to drive to the top in 2WD.  Park in 90Â° pull-out on L at 35.7987,-83.0458.  (Room for 2 small cars.)  There are multiple spots where the road is so steep that 2WD spins its tires as gravel flows downhill, and the steepness doesn't end until you reach the sharp turn just before the summit.

#### Trail Guide

* **Duration**: 1.5 miles, 55 minutes up; 35 down. (When very tired.)
* **Navigation**
    * Walk up-hill.  Follow the main road to the VORTAC
    * At 1.2 miles, road makes a sharp left
        * At the sharp left, the AT can be reached via a short (100') trail heading SW from the bend (behind the pole), and it parallels the road to the top.  It is 200' more walk, but nicer than walking the road.
    * VORTAC at 1.3.  Follow the AT east about 0.1 to 35.7886,-83.05038, to avoid VORTAC QRM. Don't activate near the VORTAC -- it is just an ugly space. If you walk 200' along the AT, there's a nice camping spot with a lovely view of the mountains. (No shade.)
    * Not only is the road too steep for 2WD, it is too steep to comfortably walk. In 2019, I started the walk feeling good and freshly caffeinated. By the time I reached the sharp left, where the steepness ends, I was resting after every few steps.
* **Trailhead altitude**: ~3485' @ 35.7987,-83.0458 parking
* **Summit altitude**: 4260' @ 35.7897, -83.0525

#### Summit Guide
