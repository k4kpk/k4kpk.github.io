####Trail Guide

* **Duration**: 0.2 miles, 10 minutes
* **Navigation**
    * Walk up-hill
    * Walk past the gate
    * Follow the road to the VORTAC
    * At 1.2 miles, road makes a sharp left
        * At the sharp left, the AT can be reached via a short (150') trail heading SW from the bend, and the AT parallels the road to the top.  It is maybe 100' more walk, but it is nicer than walking on the road.
    * VORTAC at 1.3
    * I followed the AT east from the VORTAC about 0.1 to 35.7886,-83.05038, where I found a nice spot to operate away from VORTAC QRM.
