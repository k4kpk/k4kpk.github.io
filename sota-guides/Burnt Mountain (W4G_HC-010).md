Burnt Mountain: Drive to Trailhead & Trail Guide
--------------------------------------------------------

Can't get there yet.  It is on private property, with prominent "No Trespassing" signs.  I scouted the location on November 9, 2013.  The closest you can get to the summit are gates at Monument Road.  The gates are at the ends of [http://goo.gl/maps/zvYB2](http://goo.gl/maps/zvYB2) at 34.54345, -84.3693 and 34.535883, -84.34485.  The signs have no information regarding who to contact.

When looking at the map before traveling there, I had thought about following the power line, if the road was un-travelable.  Don't do it.  The No Trespassing signs are pretty clear, and there are signs along Georgia Highway 136 too.

Monument Road is paved, and it looks like it once had a double yellow stripe down the middle.  The map shows a dirt road from Monument Road to the summit.  There are cell antennas on the summit.  It should be an easy walk from the gate at 34.535883, -84.34485, if you can just get permission.

While I was moping around one of the gates, a couple of men came walking down the road.  They explained that they had permission from the owner.  I asked how to reach the owner.  They were pretty vague.  "The something-or-other Land Trust owns it.  Check with the Pickens County Tax Assessor's office.  That's where I got the contact name."

There was another car parked at the gate.  I left a note asking the driver to share contact info for the property owner with me.  I'll update this post if I find anything more.
