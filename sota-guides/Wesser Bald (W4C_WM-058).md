#### Trail Guide

* **Duration**: 
    * via abandoned road: 1.0 miles, 1:00 up; 0:30 DOWN. 
      * In 2020, I took it slow, with no other hills first. It was exhausting.  1:00 includes climbing the tower stairs.
      * Allow an extra 5-10 minutes for setup/teardown, betause I'm timid at heights.
    * via AT 1.4 miles, 0:45 down
* **Navigation**: You have two choices.  Both depart to your left, facing the direction you drove in:
    * Follow the AT north from the gap road for 1.4 miles to the tower.
    * Follow the dirt road north from the gap for about the same. It is a steep climb with no level spots.
    * The dirt road is 0.4 shorter.  If you take the trail, watch for the short side trail to your R (to the tower) when you reach the summit.
