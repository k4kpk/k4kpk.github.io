#### Pre-planning notes:

* AC4M says: For Beech Mountain we went up a residential street seeking access to the top not knowing what we would encounter, we ran into a fellow leaving his house and asked him how to get up there. He told us someone else was in the area not long ago looking for access. He told me he could not give us permission for the ski slope itself, but told us we could park in his parking space and we could walk to the top via the ski slope. I noticed at the top of the mountain they were building a new restaurant or something and notice there is a road up there, but I am not sure were you can get on the road at or if it is open etc.
