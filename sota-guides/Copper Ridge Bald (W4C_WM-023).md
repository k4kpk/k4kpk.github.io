* **Seasonal/Limited Access**: Dirt road.  No scheduled closures, but there is a gate so it could be closed in bad weather.

* **Directions**: Note: Two routes exist - via I-985 or I-575.  I think I-985 is faster.  The entire route is very drivable for my Prius.  The dirt road is always well-graded with no potholes or runoff gulleys.
