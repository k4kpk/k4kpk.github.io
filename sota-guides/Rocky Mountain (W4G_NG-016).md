#### Trail Guide

* **Duration**: 1:30 up; 1:15 down, 1.3 miles, 800' elevation gain
* **Navigation**
    * Take the old road bed right at the tip of the sharp right in Cooper Creek Rd. After a few feet, take the L fork toward the creek. 
    * When you reach the ridge line, follow road bed off to the right, up the ridge line SOUTH.  
    * At Locust Gap, make a 90-degree left turn onto a lesser road bed.  This lesser road degrades to a trail. 
    * After 0.15 miles, trail bears R, to bypass the summit. Begin ~0.7 mile bushwhack to L, following ridge to summit. 
      * The bushwhack becomes strenuous and briar-ridden. Very slow hike at this point.
      * My GPS track *up* includes a side trip to see whether the road eventualy doubles back and goes up.  It doesn't so far as I could see. Don't take that little detour. Take the reverse of my downward trek.
    * GPS failure return route: Head NORTH down the ridge to its bottom. Then EAST to road. If you have trouble finding the road, there's a creek east of your route, and the creek crosses the road just before the sharp right where you parked.
* **GPS tracks/waypoints**:
    * Summit: 34.7486, -84.0861 @ 3820'
    * Trailhead: 34.73834,-83.99398 @ ~3040'
    * Grid Square: EM84ar
