<p>Commentary:</p>

<p>I hiked most of the way up from the visitor center with my youngest son.  Then I realized that I forgot the iPhone and I’d left it sitting in plain view.  We hiked back down to rescue it.  Then we took the shuttle to the upper parking lot.</p>

<p>I used an AlexLoop for the first time.  I tried 40m, 20m, 17m, 15m, 12m, and 10m.  I had success on 20m, limited success on 15m and 17m, and a single very weak contact on 12m.</p>

<p>Whenever a tourist would come along and look like he/she might interrupt me, I shout, “Tour guide!” and my 9 year-old son would put down his book, hop up and give a little lecture on SOTA and the finer points of the ionosphere.  He has a big vocabulary for a kid his age.  It was fun watching people react.</p>
