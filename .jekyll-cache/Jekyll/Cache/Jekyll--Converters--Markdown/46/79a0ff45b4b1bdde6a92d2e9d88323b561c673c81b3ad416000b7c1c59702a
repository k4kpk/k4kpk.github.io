I"ã<p>Many of you have heard of the <a href="http://www.norcalqrp.org/norcaldoublet.htm">Norcal Doublet</a>, which uses 4-conductor ribbon cable.  I couldnâ€™t find a <em>cheap</em> source for 50â€™ of ribbon cable, but Home Depot sells 50â€™ flat telephone extension cords for less than $8.  It too has 4 conductors.  I thought it might be interesting to see how it might work as an alternative to the Norcal Doublet.</p>

<p>First â€œlearning:â€ A CETech (Home Depot House Brand) 50â€™ telephone cord actually measures 47â€™ 3.5â€.  I guess thatâ€™s 50â€™ like a nominal 2x4 is 1.5â€ x 3.5â€.  So instead of having 22â€™ dipole legs and a 28â€™ feed line, Iâ€™m going to have 22â€™ dipole legs and an approximately 25â€™ feed line.</p>
