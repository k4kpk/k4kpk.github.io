<p>There are 2 routes to Indian Grave Gap:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Indian Grave Gap Road - this has a shallow creek ford. The creek bed is lined with fist-sized rocks. I’ve never had a problem crossing it with my Corolla, but it is always scary because I can’t really see what the creek bed looks like. The road itself is always in very good condition for a forest service dirt road.</li>
  <li>Tray Mountain Road - Tray Mountain Road from GA-75 to Indian Grave Gap Road. In 2020, this had scary erosion gullies and a huge mud wallow.  I had to leave the road and drive between trees to get around it. There is a metal towing company sign nailed to a tree by the mud wallow!  Note that this is Tray Mountain Road <em>before</em> reaching Indian Grave Gap road.  (The stretch of Tray Mountain Road from Indian Grave Gap Road to Tray Gap is <em>different</em> problem stretch.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Shorter hike and less climb from the Indian Grave Gap trailhead.</p>

<p>NOTE: <strong>Do not drive through Helen!</strong></p>
