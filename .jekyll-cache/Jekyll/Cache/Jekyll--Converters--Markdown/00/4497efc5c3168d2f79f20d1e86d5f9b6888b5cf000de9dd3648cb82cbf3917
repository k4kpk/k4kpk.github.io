<ul>
  <li><strong>Duration</strong>: 2:10 Estimated.</li>
  <li><strong>Google Maps</strong> URL from Atlanta (33.917, -84.3378): https://goo.gl/maps/yRzXq7qJRrG2</li>
  <li><strong>Seasonal/Limited Access</strong>: Last bit is steep, dirt road.  Impassible in 2014; re-graded in 2015.</li>
  <li><strong>Directions</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Take a good street-capable GPS and pre-load maps, if necessary.  You’ll want it for your final approach, where Google Maps and reality diverge.</li>
      <li>N on GA-400 and go 47 miles.</li>
      <li>At end of 400 (@ GA-60) go straight onto GA-115. Go 4.8</li>
      <li>GA-115 turns R.  Go 11.4.</li>
      <li>L on Tesnatee Gap Valley Rd. There’s a left turn lane.  Go 2.8.</li>
      <li>Go straight onto McAfee Rd. (Tesnatee turns left.)  Go 0.2</li>
      <li>L on US-129 N at T.  Go 0.8.</li>
      <li>R on GA-75A. Go 8.2.</li>
      <li>L on GA-75 and go 16.6</li>
      <li>Stop – Make sure all of your GPS are turned on and you’re tracking your route.</li>
      <li>R on GA-2/US-76E and go 5.2.</li>
      <li>The final approach to the trailhead (about 15 minutes):
        <ul>
          <li>L on Upper Hightower Rd (sign to Mt Pleasant Church of God) and go 1.6</li>
          <li>Upper Hightower Rd makes a 90 degree left turn; follow it. Go 1.6.</li>
          <li>Road becomes 1 lane and loses the center stripe.  About this point, it forks, and the left fork is Jack Branch Rd.  Stay to the right.  Go 0.2.</li>
          <li>There is a gravel road to the right. Do NOT take it.  Go 0.2.</li>
          <li>Fork to left is marked private. Keep right.  Go 0.1.</li>
          <li>If the road is too rough to continue, park at wide spot in road.  Room for 3-4 cars.  There’s a buried-fiber-optic post marking the spot.</li>
          <li>Otherwise, continue 0.8 miles to the AT.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>In 2014, there were 2-foot deep erosion gullies which could tip a Jeep and had been observed to break a truck frame.
        <ul>
          <li>Be prepared to back out, if necessary.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Food</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Last McDonalds: GA-53 on GA-400.
        <ul>
          <li>There is a McDonalds in Hiawasee that opens at 6 AM 7 days a week, but it is out of your way.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Notes</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>If you can’t reach Blue Ridge Gap, you can safely get a Prius as far as 34.95928,-83.60615.  This adds 0.8 miles and 560’ of climb to your hike (one-way).</li>
    </ul>

  <li><strong>Navigation</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Head south (to your right, as you drive up Charlies Creek rd) on the AT for 2.6 miles.</li>
      <li>The trip begins with an 0.6 mile 400’ climb up As Knob.</li>
      <li>Then you descend As Knob for about 3/4 mile to Plumorchard Gap Shelter.</li>
      <li>Then you make a 1/2 mile climb to an unnamed gap.</li>
      <li>There’s 1/2 mile of minor up and down.</li>
      <li>Ending with an 0.2 mile, 300’ climb from Bull Gap to the high point of the trail near Buzzard Knob.</li>
      <li>Heading back to the car, there’s a little climb after the initial drop, and the only other real climb is the 150’ ascent up As Knob near the end, so you can hustle.</li>
    </ul>

<h4 id="summit-guide">Summit Guide</h4>

<ul>
  <li>The high point on the trail is definitely within the activation zone.  I have measured 34.93261,-83.60191 as being 80-90 feet down from the summit, and the trail high point is well above that.</li>
  <li>The summit is nothing special.  Activate anywhere convenient within the zone.</li>
  <li>Hang antenna from tree: Heavy vegetation makes it challenging.</li>
  <li>Space to guy mast: Heavy vegetation makes it challenging.</li>
  <li>2013 Cell coverage: Good. AT&amp;T had 3G internet. VZN SMS good. No APRS msgs or beacons worked.</li>
