<p>Commentary:</p>

<p>I drove to the trailhead, but did not hike to the summit.  This summit is on Cherokee land.  The Mile High Campground, near the trailhead, is run by a Cherokee.  I had planned to ask him for permission, but the campground closed for winter on October 15.</p>

<p>There is a gate across the trail.  In my book, crossing a gate on private land is trespassing, so I did not cross the gate.</p>
