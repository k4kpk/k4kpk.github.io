<ul>
  <li><strong>Duration</strong>: 2 miles; 1:40 up, 1:30 down.</li>
  <li><strong>Navigation</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>See http://www.peakbagger.com/climber/ascent.aspx?aid=286881</li>
      <li>Blue blazed; poorly maintained; overgrows; check topo, but it doesnâ€™t match the topo.</li>
      <li>The first 1.4 miles follow an old road that contours along the W flank of Rough Ridge, and the last 0.7 is an assault on the ridge, gaining 540 feet in just 0.4 miles. The trail does cross directly over the summit.</li>
      <li>Cross 5 berms to reach an abandoned dirt road. Follows the winding road, climbing gently.</li>
      <li>After 1.0 mile on the road, elevation 3660, youâ€™ll see a dip in the ridge on your R.</li>
      <li>Leave the trail here and climb through open woods to reach the ridge at 3700.</li>
      <li>Turn L (north) and walk up onto the 3880 ridge that leads N/NE toward the summit.</li>
      <li>At 1.5 miles, youâ€™ll encounter the blue blazes again.
        <ul>
          <li>To your left, the Pond Mountain Trail followed the road a total of 1.4 miles from the trailhead and went down and then up steeply to reach the ridge. You short-cutted several hundred yards and reduced your climb.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>At 1.75 miles (4240â€™) you reach boulders on the SW end of the summit ridge. The summit is 0.25 miles NE. Trail is poorly marked and overgrown.  Treat it like a bushwhack.</li>
