<p>Commentary:</p>

<p>Beautiful spring weather, a pleasant trail followed by a moderate bushwhack, and lots of contacts on the summit – <em>this</em> is why I summit.</p>

<p>My trailhead is accessed via USFS-44, and a section of the road washed out and was closed.  I knew this section was near my trailhead, so I had some concern it wouldn’t be accessible.  The road was gated about 100 feet past my trailhead.  The trail up from 44 to Poplar Stomp Gap is a continuous climb, but it is never so steep as to be exhausting.  The first half skirts a wildlife management burn.  After it passes the fire break, it is like walking on a garden trail – an even surface with short grass and no evidence of recent vehicular traffic.</p>

<p>I’d spoken with a variety of people about the easiest route to Poplar Stomp Gap, including other activators, an official with the Georgia Appalachian Trail Conference, and the Forest Service.  The FS person wasn’t entirely clear on where I was speaking of, and the GATC person said, “That route is outside our comfort zone,” and he proceeded to suggest a longer route, so I wasn’t sure of what to expect.  To any future activator/hiker seeking to read Poplar Stomp Gap, this is <em>definitely</em> the easy route.</p>

<p>My bushwhack from the Appalachian Trail to the summit followed the approximate route which the AT followed 25+ years ago, but I could find no trace of the old trail.</p>

<p>I had more contacts on the summit than I’ve ever had before, with 3 S2S.  The closest was KI4SVM, also in north Georgia, and the farthest was KD9KC in New Mexico.  My thanks to the chaser who clued me in to Mike’s call.  I’d have missed it otherwise.</p>

<p>As I was packing up, I heard rustling in the bushes and I was joined by the Atlanta Outdoor Club.  It is unusual for me to meet <em>anyone</em> on a bushwhack, let alone 10 someones with 2 trail dogs.  They scuffed around in the leaves looking for the benchmark and then they hurried back down the trail whence they came.</p>

<p>I drifted west on my return bushwhack, and the terrain kept pushing me west, so the trip downhill was longer than the trip up.  Back at Poplar Stomp Gap, I encountered a solo backpacker who was consulting his AT guide.  “Where ya headed?” I asked.</p>

<p>He responded, “Maine, I think.  I hope I’m headed in the right direction!”  It turns out that he just passed his Extra Class exam, so we chatted about rigs, antennas, and propagation.</p>
