<p>Commentary:</p>

<p>Perfect weather, beautiful site, intermediate-level hike. Lotsa driving on dirt roads.</p>

<p>Competing for bandwidth with the ARRLâ€™s Sweepstakes contest was brutal. I briefly found an unused frequency, but I wasnâ€™t able to hold it for long. After a few minutes, there was a contester who couldnâ€™t hear my 5 watts. One of my contacts announced that the frequency IS in use (thanks!), but I donâ€™t think the contester heard him either.</p>

<p>17 meters was also pretty busy, but made a good alternate.</p>

<p>Contacts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>5 QSO at 5 watts on 17 meters - 18.1385 MHz SSB</li>
  <li>5 QSO at 5 watts on 20 meters - 14.285 MHz SSB</li>
  <li>Thank you chasers!</li>
</ul>

<p>Radio: Elecraft KX3</p>

<p>Antennas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Easy site for antennas.</li>
  <li>Throw wires in a tree - use low trees around the clearing.</li>
  <li>Tie a wire to the tower.</li>
  <li>There arenâ€™t any really tall trees.</li>
  <li>Big clear area at the end of the road. Warning: You may need to pound stakes with a rock. The roadbed is dense.</li>
</ul>

<p>Antennas I used:</p>

<ul>
  <li>20 meters - EFHW on 31â€™ Jackite with EARCHI 20 meter matchbox. Guyed it in the roadbed.</li>
  <li>17 meters - W3EDP - run through the trees. Twin-lead followed by single strand of speaker wire. I used my mast poles to push it into the trees.</li>
  <li>Iâ€™d like to further refine my antenna arsenal for better 17 meter coverage. I used a W3EDP for 17 meters, and this is suboptimal. Maybe next time Iâ€™ll carry EFHW wires for 20 and 17, and just drop and re-raise my mast in between.</li>
</ul>

<p>I erected my Jackite in the clearing, away from my W3EDP. I wanted to experiment with both antennas. For non-experimenting use, I could have simply leaned my Jackite into a tree. (Thatâ€™s what I did with the mast supporting my W3EDP.)</p>
