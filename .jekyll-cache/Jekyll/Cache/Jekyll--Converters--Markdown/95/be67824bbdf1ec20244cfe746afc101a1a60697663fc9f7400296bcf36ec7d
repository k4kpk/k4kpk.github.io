<p>Perfect weather, beautiful site, intermediate-level hike.  Lotsa driving on dirt roads.</p>

<p>Competing for bandwidth with the ARRL‚Äôs Sweepstakes contest was brutal.  I briefly found an unused frequency, but I wasn‚Äôt able to hold it for long.  After a few minutes, there was a contester who couldn‚Äôt hear my 5 watts.  One of my contacts announced that the frequency <em>IS</em> in use (thanks!), but I don‚Äôt think the contester heard him either.</p>

<p>17 meters was also pretty busy, but made a good alternate.</p>

<h2 id="contacts">Contacts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>5 QSO at 5 watts on 17 meters - 18.1385 MHz SSB</li>
  <li>5 QSO at 5 watts on 20 meters - 14.285 MHz SSB</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you chasers!</p>

<h2 id="antennas">Antennas</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Easy site for antennas.
    <ul>
      <li>Throw wires in a tree - use low trees around the clearing.</li>
      <li>Tie a wire to the tower.</li>
      <li>There aren‚Äôt any really tall trees.</li>
      <li>Big clear area at the end of the road.  Warning: You may need to pound stakes with a rock.  The roadbed is dense.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Antennas I used:
    <ul>
      <li>20 meters - EFHW on 31‚Äô Jackite with EARCHI 20 meter matchbox. Guyed it in the roadbed.</li>
      <li>17 meters - W3EDP - run through the trees.  Twin-lead followed by single strand of speaker wire.  I used my mast poles to push it into the trees.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I‚Äôd like to further refine my antenna arsenal for better 17 meter coverage.  I used a W3EDP for 17 meters, and this is suboptimal.  Maybe next time I‚Äôll carry EFHW wires for 20 and 17, and just drop and re-raise my mast in between.</p>

<p>I erected my Jackite in the clearing, away from my W3EDP.  I wanted to experiment with both antennas.  For non-experimenting use, I could have simply leaned my Jackite into a tree.  (That‚Äôs what I did with the mast supporting my W3EDP.)</p>

<h2 id="cell-phone-coverage">Cell Phone Coverage</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Intermittent cell coverage is available at the fire tower, using my iPhone 3gs.  Sometimes I got 3 bars; sometimes I got ‚ÄúNo Signal.‚Äù  I did manage to SOTA-spot via SMS.  Coverage seemed best at WNW in the parking circle, facing NW.  Sit.  Be patient.</li>
  <li>Cell towers exist in Eton, perhaps because of the large carpet mills.</li>
  <li>There‚Äôs a cell tower along the brief stretch of Crandal Ellijay road you‚Äôll drive.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="getting-there---driving">Getting There - Driving</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Reset your odometer at each turn.</li>
  <li>Note: Another valid route, about as good is http://goo.gl/maps/iiV2r and it has lots in common with routes to some other hills I‚Äôve done.  (‚ÄúFamiliar‚Äù is good.)</li>
  <li>Driving north on 411 from McDonald‚Äôs in Chattsworth, GA.
** Total drive time from here to trailhead parking is about 60 minutes.  You can do it in 5 minutes less if you drive too fast on dirt roads.  It will take much longer if you get behind a drives-slow-on-dirt-roads driver.</li>
  <li><strong>5.9 miles</strong>, turn right on Grassy St  (just past the Eton Post Office).</li>
  <li><strong>0.4 miles</strong>, turn right on Crandall Ellijay Rd</li>
  <li><strong>300 ft</strong>, turn left on Mill Creek Rd.
    <ul>
      <li>Google Maps makes it look like there are two Mill Creek Roads (as of November 2012).  There aren‚Äôt.  The first one on Google is the real one.</li>
      <li>Mill Creek Rd turns to dirt after a few tenths of a mile.  As of November 2012, it is a good condition dirt road, about 1.5 lanes wide.</li>
      <li>At 6.4 miles, stay left.  (Right goes to a campground.)</li>
      <li>Mill Creek Rd becomes known as FS-630.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>8.6 miles</strong>, acute right onto FS-17 at 34.89911, -84.64720
    <ul>
      <li>Google calls it W. Cowpen Rd.</li>
      <li>Google shows a T intersection (3-way).  It is really a 4-way.</li>
      <li>Dirt road going up-hill. About 1 lane wide.  There‚Äôs a gate.  It was open for me in mid-November.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>3.2 miles</strong>, turn right onto FS-68.  (Google calls it Conasauga Lake Rd)</li>
  <li>You‚Äôll come to a T, with overflow camping to your left.  Go right, toward the campground.</li>
  <li>Don‚Äôt park in the campground.</li>
  <li>Continue past the campground entrance a bit and take the marked right turn toward the picnic/boat-launch areas.  Picnic is the preferred parking area for day use.  There‚Äôs a gate.  It was closed in mid-November.</li>
  <li>Continue a bit and turn right, to the boat launch ramp.</li>
  <li>Park in the small lot, just before the ramp.  GPS coordinates: 34.86002, -84.65275</li>
  <li>Walk the circum-lake trail counter-clockwise about 0.1 mile until you reach the dam.  The trail description begins from the dam.</li>
</ul>

<p>Total drive time from Perimeter Mall in Atlanta was 2:40.  That‚Äôs a ‚Äúbest case‚Äù drive time.</p>

<p>Google Maps makes it look like you can drive up to the fire tower.  The road is gated.  Only Forest Service trucks get to drive there.</p>

<h2 id="getting-there---hiking">Getting There - Hiking</h2>
<p>The trail notes begin from the dam, at Lake Conasauga.  There‚Äôs a trail around the lake.  You want to start your hike proceeding counter-clockwise, from mid-dam.</p>

<p>The hike took 1:20 going in and 47 minutes coming back.  I was moving as fast as I could in both directions.  (I was running late because the drive takes longer than Google estimates.)</p>

<ul>
  <li>At the end of the dam, turn right on trail 99.</li>
  <li>Follow the trail.  After a bit, it will head downhill.  You‚Äôll find yourself wondering, ‚ÄúHow will I make it to a fire tower by traveling downhill.‚Äù  It is a good trail, but in Fall, it can be a little indistinct, due to heavy leaf cover.</li>
  <li>You‚Äôll come to a T, with a huge trail map sign.  (You enter the T from the base.)</li>
  <li>Turn right.  Almost immediately, you‚Äôll cross a beaver dam.</li>
  <li>Immediately after crossing the dam, take the trail to your left.</li>
  <li>When Songbird and the Fire Tower trails split, take the right fork.  It has a metal post with ‚Äú99‚Äù on it.</li>
  <li>When you pass a large boulder on your right, in a small valley, look right.  The trail makes a 90 degree right turn here.  Hikers sometimes miss this turn.  When I hiked it in November 2012, the Blaze Fairy had tagged occasional trees with small, bright green, metal tags.  This turn is marked, but vandals sometimes remove blazes.</li>
  <li>After a long, up-hill slog, you‚Äôll join the grassy dirt road, running up the ridge to the fire tower.</li>
  <li>There‚Äôs a big clearing at the fire tower.  It is a short, wide tower.</li>
</ul>
