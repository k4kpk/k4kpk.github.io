I"L<p>A quick overview of some Morse/CW training programs.  There are others.  These are just the ones I’ve looked into.</p>

<p>I’m at a peculiar skill level – I can copy random, perfectly-spaced characters at about 20 WPM.  I’m only good for 15 WPM if the text has meaning.  Moderate noise doesn’t bother me too much.  A sloppy fist will slow me to about 10 WPM.  If I’m expecting a call sign and RST and you send me chatter, I’ll get completely lost.</p>

<h3 id="i-think-these-are-interesting-for-ordinary-cw-training">I think these are interesting, for ordinary CW training:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Lcwo.net - characters, random sentences, call signs.  Good place to start.  Learn characters and move on to another option.</li>
  <li>AA9PW.com/morsecode - characters, news headlines, simulated QSO.</li>
  <li>http://seiuchy.macache.com - short lines from a QSO. Optional bad fist.  No noise. Works on Safari, Firefox; not Chrome.</li>
  <li>G4FON trains random letters with noise and bad fist.  It does do some QSOs.  It does not do news headlines. Wine works.</li>
  <li><a href="http://morsecode.ninja">http://morsecode.ninja</a> Many hours of audio files from 15-50wpm+ in 2-3wpm increments. Has a SOTA Activators/Chasers audio file.</li>
  <li>MorseRunner - I’ve decided this one is great practices for SOTA.  It is written as a contest trainer, with QRM,  QRN, and pileups, but the exchange is close enough to a SOTA exchange to be good practice for on-the-air.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="maybe-useful-for-specialty-cw">Maybe useful for specialty CW:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>RufzXP - just call signs, very fast.</li>
  <li>http://www.dxatlas.com/MorseRunner/ - contest simulation, with noise.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="i-found-nothing-to-interest-me">I found nothing to interest me:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Morse Mania - similar to AA9PW web site’s simulated QSO. (I’d rather use the AA9PW web site. You <em>could</em> find this one useful if you need to run offline.)</li>
  <li>G4ILO Morse Machine - just characters.</li>
  <li>AD5RX doesn’t run on current-generation Mac OS X.  (Maybe it was on PowerPC chip set?)</li>
</ul>
