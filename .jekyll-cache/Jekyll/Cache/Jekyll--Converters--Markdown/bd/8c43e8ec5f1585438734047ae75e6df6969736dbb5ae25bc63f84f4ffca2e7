I"Ñ<p><em>I want to activate a summit.  I donâ€™t want to read a lot. Whatâ€™s the minimum I need to know?</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Go to <a href="http://sotamaps.wsstvc.org/">http://sotamaps.wsstvc.org/</a> and pick out a valid SOTA summit.  Learn its â€œSummit ID.â€
    <ul>
      <li>See <a href="/content/how-choose-summit-sota-maps">How to Pick a Summit from SOTA Maps</a>, for a brief tutorial.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>(Optional) Post an activation alert at [http://sotawatch.org/alerts.php].  This tells chasers when youâ€™ll be there.</li>
  <li>Go to the top of the mountain.  If you can drive to the top, donâ€™t.  Be sure to park at least 100â€™ (elevation) below the summit, and walk the rest of the way to the top.</li>
  <li>Make at least 4 QSOs from the summit.  You donâ€™t have to be exactly at the apex.  Any 4 hams will suffice; it doesnâ€™t matter whether theyâ€™re SOTA chasers.</li>
  <li>When youâ€™re home, submit your log using the â€œSubmit Logâ€ menu at <a href="http://sotadata.org.uk/">http://sotadata.org.uk/</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>If you donâ€™t have a user ID on the site, youâ€™ll have to sign up for one.</li>
      <li>Ensure that you enter ALL of your contacts.  (See â€œAdmire your resultsâ€ below.)  This ensures youâ€™ll get your points and your chasers can confirm they really talked with you.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>(Optional) Admire your results at <a href="http://sotadata.org.uk/">http://sotadata.org.uk/</a> by choosing â€œView Resultsâ€, then â€œMy Resultsâ€, then â€œMy Activator Logâ€.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Iâ€™ve left out things like registering to use some of the web sites, figuring out how to get to the trailhead, etc.  This is the â€œCliff Notesâ€ version of the procedure.</p>
