<p>Chilly (for Georgia) activation with some weather surprises. This would be a ‘piece of cake’ activation in the fall, or in a dry patch of winter weather.</p>

<p>It was 26 degrees when I left the car and 33 when I returned. As I hiked up from the trailhead, things turned from no snow, to a light dusting, to about 6 inches. The big surprise was that a recent ice storm left trees and underbrush coated with a thick layer of ice.</p>

<p>Hiking the AT was easy. (I am grateful to the volunteers who maintain it.) I expected I’d find a side trail to the summit from the high point of the AT. No such luck. The final quarter mile was a bushwhack through ice encrusted underbrush and a thicket of young trees in the understory.</p>

<p>Most of my QSOs were at 5 watts, but a few may have been at 10. I used 8 lithium AA cells, and the KX3 will let me set 10 watts of transmit power, but the first time I speak a little too loud, the voltage dips, and it reduces power to 5. I’m going to log the first QSO at 10 watts and the rest at 5.</p>

<p>I couldn’t have made it to the summit without my GPS. I couldn’t have made it back to the trail without my GPS. I don’t like having my life depend upon electronica. (In my defense, my iPhone also has a GPS, so I did have a Plan B.) Gotta carry a sturdy compass on future trips. The battery meter fell from full-bars down to 1 really fast. (To be expected with Lithium batteries which had been used on prior summits.) Glad I carried spare GPS batteries!</p>

<p>As the temperature rose and the sun hit the trees, they started dropping ice and snow. I was worried I’d lose my rig or my log to a direct hit, so I didn’t stay long enough to get all callers. The fact that I was perched on a sloped rock to get out of the snow, and was slowly sliding off toward a drift added to my enthusiasm to get off the summit.</p>

<p>I’d been asked to activate on 40 meters too, and I agreed to try, time permitting. Circumstances did not permit, and I apologize to chasers who couldn’t reach me on 20. I hadn’t planned on the ice storm remnants.</p>

<p>Summit - I operated from 34.87812, -83.65638, which was well inside the activation zone, but not at the exact apex. GPS measured altitude at 4242. Based on Lat/Lon, I was within the 4250 contour line. SOTAdata calls the peak at 4301 feet (1311 meters). Either way, it was well within the 75 ft activation zone. I prefer to operate from the apex, but there were several times during the bushwhack when I said, “I’m not going to summit,” so I’m relieved that the GPS evidence shows that I made it.</p>

<p>Contacts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>9 QSO at 5 or 10 watts on 20 meters. 14.339-ssb.</li>

<p>Thank you chasers! Given the slog through the ice, I am exceptionally grateful that you were there when I called CQ.</p>

<p>Airtime: 11:30 AM Eastern on 30 December, 2012</p>

<p>Radio: Elecraft KX3.</p>

<p>Antennas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Icy, dense brush created antenna challenges. I recommend carrying a mast and using bungee cords or velcro to bind it to a tree.</li>
  <li>EARCHI 20m matchbox with an EFHW. Messily hung with a combination of short mast and zigzag through trees.</li>
</ul>

<p>I was running late. I’d planned to use a slingshot to launch my antenna. The trees and brush were thick enough to make that difficult. I’d also switched from using a fishing weight to a large steel nut, and I kept hitting the uprights of the slingshot! I didn’t expect to be able to self-spot, so as my alert time came and went I was getting desperate to get SOMETHING in the air for an antenna.</p>

<p>I grabbed a 15’ carbon fiber fishing pole that I carried ‘just in case’, zip tied the antenna near the tip, zip tied the base of the pole to a small branch, and pulled the wire as far from the pole as I could. Since I use an EFHW, I had 18’ of extra wire which I zigzagged through nearby branches as best I could.</p>

<p>Despite my ad hoc antenna, I received multiple 59 signal reports, with one operator telling me I was the strongest activator signal he’d ever received. I would have expected some attenuation from the carbon fiber pole. I pulled the wire as far from the pole as possible. Call it a “semi-sloper” configuration. Maybe I got some gain in his direction from the zigzag…</p>

<p>Hiking the AT was easy. (I am grateful to the volunteers who maintain it.) I expected I’d find a side trail to the summit from the high point of the AT. No such luck. The final quarter mile was a bushwhack through ice encrusted underbrush and a thicket of young trees in the understory.</p>

<p>My QSOs were at 5 watts. I used 8 lithium AA cells, but since I used them on another peak earlier in the day, voltage had dropped too low for 10 watts.</p>

<p>I couldn’t have made it to the summit without my GPS.</p>

<p>As the temperature rose and the sun hit the trees, they started dropping ice and snow. I was worried I’d lose my rig or my log to a direct hit, so as soon as chasers stopped responding, I got off the summit. (I like to continue calling for a few minutes. Often there is a second wave of chasers, who just need a few more minutes to get the rig fired up after a spot.)</p>

<p>Plus, it was getting late, and I wanted to make it back to paved roads before dark. On the way in, I dodged a beer bottle on Wildcat Road and I wanted to stop and collect it on the way back – not run over it!</p>

<p>Summit - I operated from the absolute apex for this one.</p>

<p>I did this summit immediately after activating Double Spring Knob, so my hike for this one begins at Addis Gap. (I did not hike back to my car on the road.)</p>

<ul>
  <li>I was able to successfully slingshot a heavy monofilament fishing line into a tree; I used that to hoist up my 33 ft wire.</li>
