I"æ<p>Summit Activated: W4G/CE-003 Stone Mountain  Date: 10 November, 2012</p>

<p>An easy activation, convenient to Atlanta.  The hardest part was finding a parking place at the trailhead on a sunny Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>There are plenty of places to support an antenna in the activation zone.  There‚Äôs a fence on the south side, near the trail, protecting rare flora.  It could be used to support a vertical.  I found a dwarf tree, a little north of the summit, and bungee corded a 31‚Äô fiberglass mast to it, for an EFHW for 20 meters.</p>

<p>It was a good opportunity to spread a little public awareness.  Lots of interest from tourists about what I was doing.  On the way up, a group of teens (or 20-somethings) asked if I was going camping.  When I explained that I was going to set up a portable radio station and talk with people in Europe, there was lots murmuring of ‚Äúcool.‚Äù  There‚Äôs an opportunity to interest the young in ham radio here.  Setting up a radio on top of a mountain sound more like an adventure and less like a bunch of old men sitting around and yakking.  The young see themselves as adventurers and risk-takers, and we could do well to sell SOTA to high school and college kids.</p>

<p>16 contacts on 20 meters in just about 10 minutes.  My signal made it to Kansas and to England on 5 watts with my KX3.  My thanks to the chasers, who put up with me when I totally lost my train of thought as a parade of hikers marched past!</p>
