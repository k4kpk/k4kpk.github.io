<p>I want to program my KX3 to send â€œK4KPK TESTâ€ in a loop, using CW.  Iâ€™ve previously installed and configured the KX3 utility on my computer.  (See <a href="http://www.kleinfelter.com/content/updateflash-kx3-firmware-mac-first-time">these instructions</a> for help with that.)</p>

<p>Iâ€™m using a Mac with OS X 10.8, not a Windows PC.</p>

<h3 id="the-procedure">The Procedure</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Connect the cable.</li>
  <li>Start the utility.</li>
  <li>Make sure the KX3 is powered up.</li>
  <li>In the utility:
    <ul>
      <li>Select the Port tab, press â€œTest Communicationsâ€, and dismiss the message box with the success message.</li>
      <li>Select the Configuration tab.</li>
      <li>Press â€œEdit CW Memoriesâ€.</li>
      <li>Wait several seconds, while the utility reads your current CW memories.  When it is finished, the bottom of the window will say â€œReadyâ€.</li>
      <li>Enter <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">K4KPK TEST</code> in M1.</li>
      <li>Press â€œSaveâ€</li>
      <li>To back-up your configuration to your computer, press the â€œSave KX3 Buttonâ€ on the Configuration tab.</li>
      <li>Exit the utility</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Except it sometimes doesnâ€™t work.  If you re-open the edit-CW-memories window, youâ€™ll see that nothing got saved, or that only some lines got saved.  To solve this, press tab an extra time.  The Mac version of the utility has a bug and you have to tab out of a field in order for it to notice that you updated it.</p>

<h3 id="activating-the-message">Activating the Message</h3>
<p>When you are ready to send this message from the KX3:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Make sure you are tuned to the desired frequency.</em></li>
  <li><em>Make sure your power is set to the desired level.</em></li>
  <li><em>Make sure your mode is set to CW.</em></li>
  <li><em>Make sure your antenna is connected and tuned.</em></li>
  <li>Press the <strong>MSG</strong> button (on the left side of the KX3).</li>
  <li>If you want to send the message once, tap the message number (1, in this case).  If you want to loop/repeat the message, hold the message number.  To stop looping, hold MSG.</li>
</ol>
