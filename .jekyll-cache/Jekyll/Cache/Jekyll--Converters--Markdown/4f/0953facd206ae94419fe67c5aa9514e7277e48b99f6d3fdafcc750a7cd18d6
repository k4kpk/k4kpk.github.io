<p>Caution: Use bug dope. I got bug bites that took over 6 weeks to heal from my ankle to my knee while wearing hiking boots, over-the-calf socks, and long pants. My son also got similar bites (while not as thoroughly clothed). (Summer 2013)</p>

      <li>A bit more, and the road crosses a wet creek. Slippery rocks!</li>
      <li>A bit more, and youâ€™ll pass a small site with a small diesel generator, and youâ€™ll start following power lines.</li>
      <li>Then you come to the paved road with picnic â€œShelter Bâ€ and restrooms that are shown on the Alatoona Lake Trail Guide, south of Alatoona Dam Road, just below the dam.</li>
      <li>When you arrive at Alatoona Dam Road, turn right, and youâ€™re at the trailhead for the Eagle Scout Trails.</li>

<h4 id="trail-guide-my-route-out---all-season--risk-of-getting-hassled">Trail Guide (My Route Out - All Season.  Risk of getting hassled.)</h4>

<p>Iâ€™ll describe my route out. You could follow it in the opposite direction to get in.  It goes through a gated, not-yet-built subdivision.  I carefully avoided â€œNo Trespassingâ€ signs.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Take the gravel road leading south from the cell tower.</li>
  <li>Youâ€™ll come to a paved road.</li>
  <li>This looks like a subdivision, about to happen. There are lots of signs that say â€œLot xxâ€ and â€œSold,â€ and there are utility boxes, water hydrants, and sewer lines, but no houses - yet.</li>
  <li>Up the paved road to your right, thereâ€™s a gated gravel road to a water tower. I think you could walk up this road to the water tower, and then walk from the water tower to the cell tower, but I didnâ€™t try it. I definitely did see the water tower from the cell tower, and it has a clearing around it (as shown on Google Maps).</li>
  <li>Turn left onto the paved road.</li>
  <li>After a bit, you come to a gate, and a fancy house on your left, and a dirt road on your right.</li>
  <li>Take the dirt road on your right.</li>
  <li>After a bit, the dirt road forks, with a Private Property No Tresspassing sign to the right, so take the left fork.</li>
  <li>Follow this dirt road for a bit. After awhile, it sorta fades into nothing, right about the point where the topo shows a dirt road intersection. I think that what happened here is that there was a clearing at the intersection, and it filled with pine saplings. I know that the road disappears at the thicket of pine saplings.</li>
  <li>Skirt the pine thicket around its left side, generally heading south, to southwest. Youâ€™ll see the road again on your right, once youâ€™re past the short pines. Briefly. Then it fades again.</li>
  <li>Continue heading south, staying in the clearest areas, out from under most of the trees.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Youâ€™ll come to Red Top Mountain Road, and youâ€™ll be near the opposite end of the old pavement that you took when you started your hike.</p>
