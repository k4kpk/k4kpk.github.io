<ul>
  <li><strong>Special</strong>: Take cash ($2 in 2013) to pay parking fee.</li>
  <li><strong>Duration</strong>: 2:30</li>
  <li><strong>Google Maps</strong> URL from Atlanta (33.917, -84.3378):
    <ul>
      <li>Via Ellijay: http://goo.gl/maps/wcc21</li>
      <li>The part of the Google directions after Bald Mountain are confusing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Seasonal/Limited Access</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Picnic and campground were closed in 2012.11.18 when I visited; the boat ramp was open.</li>
      <li>Appears that the boat ramp and “overflow camping” is closed after Dec 31 until spring.</li>
      <li>Overflow camping is open after the regular camping because it has no running water.</li>
      <li>At the “Conasauga T” (34.84158, -84.59447), there’s a gate blocking the R turn during winter. A little ways up the road to the L (past some cabins) there’s a gate that might get closed in January and February.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Directions</strong>: Ellijay Route 2:15 (Chattsworth drive moved to separate file.  30 minutes longer.)
    <ul>
      <li>Caution. Google Maps has an obsession with USFS-78/78G, which is a jeep trail intersecting Old CCC Camp Rd at 34.815539, -84.666.</li>
      <li>I-285 West, I-75 North</li>
      <li>I-575 North. Reset trip odometer.  Continue onto GA-5 and GA-515.  Go 54 miles to Ellijay McDonalds.</li>
      <li>Go 0.5 past Ellijay McDonalds.</li>
      <li>Left on 1st Ave, to cross bridge to Ellijay. Go 0.1</li>
      <li>Left on River St (a.k.a. GA-52). Go 1 mile</li>
      <li>Ellijay downtown roundabout. Stay on 52 and go 5.1 to Gates Chapel Rd.
  <strong>From Gates Chapel Rd</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>R on Gates Chapel Rd.  (There’s a pond that you’ll see just after you turn.)  Go 5.4.
            <ul>
              <li>Pavement ends at fork.  Bear R on Wilderness Trail (Becomes FS90) Go 1.5.</li>
              <li>Hairpin R onto FS 68 (a.k.a. Conasauga Rd), go 3.2.</li>
              <li>L on Conasauga Lake Rd (FS 68 goes L; FS 64 goes R) at “Conasauga T” (34.84158, -84.59447).  Go 3.4.</li>
              <li><strong>BALD MTN TRAILHEAD</strong>: At this point, you are at the trailhead for Bald Mountain.
                <ul>
                  <li>(Note to self: Retain this.  Bald Mtn trip refers the reader here.)</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Continue on FS 68 / Conasauga Rd.  See “Final Turns” below.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>Do NOT park in the campground.  They will ticket you.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Follow main road slightly to right.  (Don’t turn left.) ** and go 0.2**.</li>

                  <li>The road to the boat ramp turns L on USFS-68C.  If picnic area is open, continue straight.  Picnic area was gated in November.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Picnic area parking is in a few hundred feet.  It has flush toilets.</li>
                      <li>If you go to the boat ramp:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Duration</strong>: 0:35 up, 0:30 down, 1.5 miles 1-way</li>
  <li><strong>Navigation</strong>: Just follow the gravel road to the fire tower at the summit.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="trail-guide---hiking-trails-past-the-dam-trails">Trail Guide - Hiking Trails Past the Dam (“Trails”)</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Duration</strong>: 1:20</li>
  <li><strong>Navigation</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The hike took 1:20 going in and 47 minutes coming back, moving fast.</li>
      <li>The trail notes begin from the dam, at Lake Conasauga. There’s a trail around the lake.</li>
      <li>You want to start your hike proceeding counter-clockwise, from mid-dam.</li>
      <li>At the end of the dam, turn right on trail 99.</li>
      <li>Follow the trail. After a bit, it will head downhill a lot. It is a good trail, but in Fall, it can be indistinct, due to heavy leaf cover.</li>
      <li>You’ll come to a T, with a huge trail map sign. (You enter the T from the base.)</li>
      <li>Turn right. Almost immediately, you’ll cross a beaver dam.</li>
      <li>Immediately after crossing the dam, take the trail to your left.</li>
      <li>When Songbird and the Fire Tower trails split, take the right fork. It has a metal post with “99” on it.</li>
      <li>When you pass a large boulder on your right, in a small valley, look right. The trail makes a 90 degree right turn here. Hikers sometimes miss this turn. There may be small, bright green, metal tags, but vandals sometimes remove blazes.</li>
      <li>After a long, up-hill slog, you’ll join the grassy dirt road, running up the ridge to the fire tower.</li>
      <li>There’s a big clearing at the fire tower. It is a short, wide tower.</li>
