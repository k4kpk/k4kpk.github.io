I"–<p>Ravencliff Knob is an ugly summit. It is interesting because it has an FAA VOR on top, and the hike is lovely, but the summit is seriously ugly.</p>

<p>The VOR is a small building, surrounded by a big gravel parking lot, surrounded by a denuded summit.  It looks like they bush-hog the vegetation and then spray it with an herbicide.  Consequently, the summit is covered in dead stubble with a powdery dirt mix.</p>

<p>To get to the gated driveway, you drive several miles up a remote dirt road.  It is an easy 0.9 mile walk from the gate at the end of the driveway.  It was a pretty day, and the leaves are starting to turn.</p>

<p>About 3/4 of the way to the summit, I saw someoneâ€™s private little bit of heaven. Waaay in the middle of nowhere, 3/4 of a mile up a gated driveway, someone has a small plot of land with power, a small grass parking area, a covered picnic table, a carport and a storage building.  It is clearly a one-trailer RV park.  Surrounded by woods.  With no neighbors for miles.  (The ugly summit is out of sight.)</p>

<p>At any rate, I had activated Standing Indian earlier this afternoon, so this was a late afternoon summit.  I had a fine session on 20m until and alligator from the California QSO party landed on me, so I switched to 40 and picked up a few more contacts.  I made it back to my car just as the sun set behind the hills.  Very nice.</p>

<p>Thank you chasers!
