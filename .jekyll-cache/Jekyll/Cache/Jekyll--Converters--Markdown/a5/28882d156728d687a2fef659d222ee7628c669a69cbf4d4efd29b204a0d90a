<h4 id="trail-guide">Trail Guide</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Duration</strong>: 0:30 up, 0:15 down; 0.5 miles</li>
  <li><strong>Navigation</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Follow the trail 0.5 miles. Starts northeast, then east, then northeast again.</li>
      <li>The trail is basically straight up the mountain, with no descent.  It goes up, but it is probably the easiest of the Georgia 10-pointers, given the modest slope and short distance.  The actual summit is off the trail about 75‚Äô and is covered with evergreens, but the trail passes through the activation zone.</li>
      <li>In summer, the trail and the summit are overgrown with greenery.  Bluejeans are advised, due to thorns crowing the trail.</li>
