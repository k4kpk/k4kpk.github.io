<h4 id="trail-guide">Trail Guide</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Duration</strong>: 1:20 up; 0:55 down; 1.6 miles and 1080 feet climb.</li>
  <li><strong>Navigation</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The AT is easy to follow.  From a navigation perspective, this is a piece of cake.  Park on one side of the highway, take the obvious trail on the other side of the highway, and follow it until there is no more â€˜upâ€™ to climb.</li>
      <li>Some maps show about a 1.1 mile hike.  Not a chance. My GPS says we walked 1.6 miles.  The maps donâ€™t show some big switchbacks.  It was about a 15% grade, so it was not a â€˜walk in the park.â€™</li>
      <li>Portions of the trail require hiker agility.  There are sections of the trail composed almost entirely of large rocks.  If youâ€™re frail, this is not a good hike.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Trailhead altitude</strong>: 2941â€™ @ Unicoi Gap Parking (34.80210, -83.74285)</li>
  <li><strong>Summit altitude</strong>: 4020â€™</li>
  <li><strong>GPS tracks/waypoints</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Trailhead: 34.80210, -83.74285</li>
      <li>The trail is obvious and it is well blazed.  Just pay attention at the double blazes, which will ensure you donâ€™t miss a switchback.</li>
      <li>GPS trace: <a href="http://k4kpk.com/sites/k4kpk.com/files/Blue%20Mountain.GPX">GPX</a></li>
      <li>There appears to be an alternate route, following USFS trail 44F from N34.79306, W83.75578 to its merge with the AT at N34.80986, W83.75380.  Flatter, but much longer walk.</li>
