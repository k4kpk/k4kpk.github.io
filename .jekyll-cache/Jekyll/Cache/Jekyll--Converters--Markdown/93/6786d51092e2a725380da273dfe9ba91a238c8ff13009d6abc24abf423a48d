<p>Big ham contests can interfere with the SOTA activation experience. There‚Äôs a contest somewhere, just about every weekend, so the best you can do is to avoid the really BIG ones.  If you must activate on a contest weekend, CW and SSB all run on different weekends - use the mode not in play for the contest that weekend or head to the WARC bands.</p>

<p>When you set a date for your activation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Check the <a href="http://www.arrl.org/contest-calendar">ARRL contest calendar</a>. (Check ‚ÄúContest Corral‚Äù at the bottom of the page to get non-ARRL contests)</li>
  <li>OR check <a href="http://www.hornucopia.com/contestcal/perpetualcal.php">http://www.hornucopia.com/contestcal/perpetualcal.php</a></li>
  <li>The big weekends to avoid are:
    <ul>
