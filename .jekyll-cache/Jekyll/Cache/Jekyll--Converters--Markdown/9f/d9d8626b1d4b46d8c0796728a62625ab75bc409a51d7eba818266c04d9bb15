<p>The best map is a National Forest Service paper map titled ‚ÄúJoyce Kilmer-Slickrock Wilderness and Citico Creek Wilderness‚Äù subtitled ‚Äúin the Nantahala and Cherokee National Forests‚Äù.  Mine says it was ‚Äúcompiled‚Äù in 1987.  The National Geograpic ‚ÄúTrail Maps‚Äù IOS application also shows the Wolf Laurel trail and Wolf Laurel Road (AKA USFS-81F, which is 2WD drivable to Wolf Laurel Basin).</p>

<p>Caution: Wear orange in hunting season (mid October to Jan 1).

<ul>
  <li><strong>Duration</strong>: 1:20 up (1.8 miles; 830‚Äô climb); 0:55 down</li>
  <li><strong>Navigation</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Wolf Laurel Trail is on left, 40 yards before the road ends at the gate.</li>
      <li>Follow Wolf Laurel Trail ~0.2 miles and turn L at the yellow Wilderness Area sign on Stratton Bald Trail.</li>
      <li>Go about 1.2 miles (~750‚Äô elevation gain).</li>
      <li>Go L at Haoe Lead Trail which comes from the right.</li>
      <li>The summit is an unremarkable point along the trail. Use GPS to locate it.  There‚Äôs a nicer spot to activate from a few hundred feet farther along the trail, where a 25‚Äô side trail leads to a flat rock in the ground and a view.</li>
      <li>Stratton Bald isn‚Äôt bald.  If you continue, you‚Äôll come to Bob‚Äôs Bald, which <em>is</em> bald, and is a nice place to camp.</li>
      <li>If you continue through Bob‚Äôs Bald and on another 1/4 mile, you‚Äôll hear running water and see a short length of white PVC pipe on your right.  This is your best bet for water.
        <ul>
          <li>There is an alternate source for water just off the top end of the clear bald.  It was too cloudy for my taste, but it might be OK with a filter.  After you enter the open bald, near its high point, turn to your left and there is a stand of green fir trees. In the hollow below the trees is the spring.  You‚Äôll find it as there are little side trails down to it.</li>
