I"‚<p>If you are a SOTA Chaser, you might be familiar with <a href="http://ww1x.com/sotagoat/">SOTA Goat</a>.  One thing which SOTA Goat does nicely is to alert you when someone has been spotted.</p>

<p>If you want a similar notification on your Windows PC, try <a href="http://www.ku6j.com">KU6Jâ€™s SOTA Spot Monitor</a>.  It will notify you whenever a SOTA activator gets spotted.</p>
