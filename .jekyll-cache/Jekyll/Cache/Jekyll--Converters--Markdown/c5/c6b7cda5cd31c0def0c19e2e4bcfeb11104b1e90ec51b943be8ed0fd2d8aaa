  <li><strong>Google Maps</strong> from Atlanta (33.917, -84.3378): http://tinyurl.com/atlanta-hightower-north</li>
  <li><strong>Seasonal/Limited Access</strong>: Unknown</li>
  <li><strong>Directions</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>I made it to the 2WD trailhead in a Prius.  Using both a Prius and a Corolla, I was unable to make it past an erosion ditch shortly after this point.  I got hung-up on my trailer hitch and had to rock the car to get out.</li>
      <li>Take a good street-capable GPS and pre-load maps, if necessary.  You’ll want it for your final approach, where Google Maps and reality diverge.</li>
      <li>N on GA-400 and go 47 miles.</li>
      <li>At end of 400 (@ GA-60) go straight onto GA-115. Go 4.8</li>
      <li>GA-115 turns R.  (About 60 minute drive to this turn.) Go 11.4.</li>
      <li>L on Tesnatee Gap Valley Rd. There’s a left turn lane.  Go 2.8.</li>
      <li>Go straight onto McAfee Rd. (Tesnatee turns left.)  Go 0.2</li>
      <li>L on US-129 N at T. (About 1:15 total drive time to this turn.) Go 0.8.</li>
      <li>R on GA-75A. Go 8.2.</li>
      <li>L on GA-75 and go 16.6</li>
      <li>Stop – Make sure all of your GPS are turned on and you’re tracking your route.</li>
      <li>R on GA-2/US-76E and go 5.2.</li>
      <li>The final approach to the trailhead (about 15 minutes):
        <ul>
          <li>L on Upper Hightower Rd (sign to Mt Pleasant Church of God) and go 1.6</li>
          <li>Upper Hightower Rd makes a 90 degree left turn; follow it. Go 1.6.</li>
          <li>Road becomes 1 lane and loses the center stripe.  About this point, it forks, and the left fork is Jack Branch Rd.  Stay to the right.  Go 0.2.</li>
          <li>There is a gravel road to the right. Do NOT take it.  Go 0.2.</li>
          <li>Fork to left is marked private. Keep right.  Go 0.1.</li>
          <li>Park at wide spot in road.  Room for 3-4 cars.  There’s a buried-fiber-optic post marking the spot.</li>
          <li>This is 0.7 miles before the AT.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>IF you have 4WD and high ground clearance (HGC), you can drive farther.
        <ul>
          <li>You’ll find some 2 foot deep erosion gullies.  You could tip your vehicle if you’re not careful.</li>
          <li>I recommend against driving all the way to the trailhead in a 2WD SUV or a 4WD passenger car (like the Subaru Forester).  You want big tires <em>and</em> 4WD.    If you have <em>either</em> 4WD or HGC, you might try driving a little farther.</li>
          <li>Be prepared to back out, if necessary.</li>

<ul>
  <li>UPDATE: This thread says Charlies Creek Rd was repaired in 2015.</li>
  <li>
    <p>UPDATE: As of June 2016, I drove from Upper Hightower Rd to the first part of Charlies Creek Rd in a Corolla, but was unable to drive to Blue Ridge Gap.  The road was too steep and I could not get traction to climb the hill.  This is currently drivable in a light 4WD such as a Forrester.  They did not re-engineer the road, so runoff is cutting erosion ditches quickly.  It won’t be long before a Jeep-type 4WD will again be required.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Duration</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>To the summit: 4:35 (5.1 miles) - one way (per my trip of 2013.04.20)</li>
      <li>From the summit to car: 4:40 (per my trip of 2013.04.20)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Navigation</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>GPS is essential for this hike.</li>
      <li>Bushwhacking strategy:
        <ul>
          <li>Once you leave the AT, you’ll want to navigate from gap to peak to gap to peak…</li>
          <li>I tried to traverse some hills, to skirt the peak.  This was a mistake.  It was slow and very hard on the knees and ankles.  When you’re in a gap, hike straight up to the top of the next peak.  When you’re on a peak, follow the ridge line down to the next gap.  (Make sure you follow the <em>correct</em> ridge line.  Some peaks have multiple ridges, and I started down a wrong one.)</li>
          <li>Follow ridge lines between gaps and peaks.
            <ul>
              <li>If you find yourself 10 yards off the ridge line, try and get back onto it.  I regretted it when I diverged from the ridge.</li>
              <li>If you find yourself 25 yards off the ridge line, take your trekking poles, whack yourself over the head in penance, and get back on the ridge line.</li>
              <li>The final 1/4 mile (approximate) approach to Hightower Bald is overgrown with dense vegetation.  You may <em>have to</em> skirt this.  I did.  Regaining the ridge line was a LOT of work. I followed the faint trail as it went slightly downhill to avoid this vegetation. Then, at some point, I said, “Too much downhill,” and headed straight up the hill.  I then encountered another faint trail and followed it for a bit until I was about 30 feet from the apex.  I then went straight up to the summit and found the 10 foot semi-clearing.  You might do better by staying closer to the ridge as you skirt the vegetation.  I think I followed the trail longer than optimal.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>There is a faint trail on much of the ridge lines.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>You can read stories on the web about how difficult this bushwhack is. For the route I describe, it is a <em>strenuous</em> hike, but only the last quarter mile or so has really bad vegetation.  There was a <em>small</em> (10’) relatively clear spot at the summit.</li>
      <li>I did this trip on April 20, 2013.  Spring ‘greening’ was just staring.  Vegetation will be much worse in summer.  I recommend making this trek after Daylight Saving Time begins (for the longer days) and no later than I did.  Brittle winter vegetation is easier to bushwhack than lush summer growth.</li>
      <li>Recommended route:
        <ul>
          <li>0.8 miles, climb 625’ [30 minutes] - Follow Charlies Creek Rd from parking to the AT.</li>
          <li>3 miles, climb 810’ [2 hours] - Follow AT to the north (left).</li>
          <li>Leave AT on the <em>north</em> side of Rich Knob, before Bly Gap.</li>
          <li>1.3 miles, climb 1000’ (net 660’) Bushwhack to HTB [2 hours]</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

  <li><strong>Trailhead altitude</strong>: 2433’ @ 2WD parking @ 34.95928, -83.60615</li>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Duration</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>2.5 miles, 3 hours, 2200’ of EG, with 1700’ of it in last last 1.4 miles.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Navigation</strong> (from Pat)
    <ul>
      <li>At the end of Eagle Fork Road (35.007059, -83.622556), hike starts along a gated Forest Service road.</li>
      <li>Road ends shortly after crossing Loggy Branch around 1.1 miles. This is where youclimb the ridgeline up to the gap below Hightower Bald.</li>
      <li>Follow the ridgeline south and up! Maintain the ridgeline as there is a decent trail most of the way up.</li>
      <li>You will have a band of rhododendron to deal with near the top, but it is walkable.</li>
      <li>Once you gain the main ridgeline turn west and make the final climb to Hightower.</li>
      <li>Summit (and AZ) is narrow and overgrown; will be dense in summertime.</li>
      <li>Pat highly recommends walking down the west ridge to Tom Gap and just up the other side a bit for a great view back towards Hightower.</li>
