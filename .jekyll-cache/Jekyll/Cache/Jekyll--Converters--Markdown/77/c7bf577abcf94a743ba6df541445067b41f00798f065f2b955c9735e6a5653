<p>Commentary:
Today I snatched victory from the jaws of defeat.  After calling CQ for 25 minutes on HF from the summit of Blood Mountain, Iâ€™d raised only 3 contacts.  I was thinking about moving my setup 20 yards and trying again, just in case I was getting a strange pattern and then throwing in the towel.</p>

<p>Then I threw a â€œHail Mary.â€  Iâ€™ve never been able to raise anyone on VHF, but I carry an HT for APRS.  (Really never â€“ as in â€˜zero contacts.â€™)  I know that one doesnâ€™t call CQ on VHF, so I went to 146.52 and used that classic call, â€œK4KPK.  Hello?  Can anyone hear me?â€  I immediately heard from 2 hams and a short time later a 3rd.</p>

<p>Then I went back to HF, pulled down my vertical and strung my EFHW through the trees at about 6â€™ and picked up 3 more contacts on 20m.</p>

<p>As I was setting up, a young man (early teens) came up to observe.  (His dad was discreetly observing from about 20â€™ away.)  As I was re-doing my antenna, I had a lovely chat with KK4NVH, who recently received his Technician license through a class/club in his school.</p>

<p>Later, as I was packing up, a backpacker paused.  Since Blood Mountain is a busy area, Iâ€™d already had several, â€œWhatâ€™s that?â€ conversations with hikers today, so I assumed this would be another one.  Then he called me by name.  Iâ€™m 70 miles (and +3400â€™ altitude) from home, and I run into someone from work!  And Iâ€™m a telecommuter, so I donâ€™t even run into people from work when Iâ€™m at work!</p>

<p>After hiking back to the car and hurrying to Dahlonega, I make it to my favorite barbecue joint, â€œSmokinâ€™ Gold,â€ 4 minutes before closing.  I ask whether it is too late to get take out because I <em>know</em> they donâ€™t want to seat me at 4 minutes to closing.  They tell me to pick a table and to take my time eating.</p>

<p>So 10 points for the activation plus my favorite barbecue, and both of them were by the skin of my teeth.  A Grand Day Out.</p>
