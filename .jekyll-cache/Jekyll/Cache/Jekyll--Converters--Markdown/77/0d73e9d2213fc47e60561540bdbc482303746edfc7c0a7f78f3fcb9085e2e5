I"<p>Kirchhoff came up with two laws.  They pretty much say the same thing: Everything going out is matched by everything coming in.  No exceptions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Kirchhoff’s Voltage law (KVL): The total of voltages leaving <strong>a node</strong> must be matched by the total of voltages entering <strong>the node</strong>.</li>
  <li>Kirchhoff’s Current law (KCL): The total of currents leaving <strong>a node</strong> must be matched by the total of currents entering <strong>the node</strong>.</li>
</ul>
