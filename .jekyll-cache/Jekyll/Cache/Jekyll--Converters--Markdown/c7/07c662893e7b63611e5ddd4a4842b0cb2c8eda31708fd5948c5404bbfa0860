I"m<p>I installed DXLabs DXKeeper on Windows XP, and it was ugly.  Content didn’t fit within the controls.  e.g. Button labels wrapped (and the button wasn’t big enough to display the wrapped content).  Drop-downs were unreadable.</p>

<p>The standard suggestion for addressing this sort of problem is to visit Display setting, and ensure that you’re using Normal font size.  Been there.  Done that. (Right-click Desktop, Properties, Settings, Advanced, Normal Size (96 DPI).)</p>

<p>I found that following this same path, setting DPI to 99%, rebooting, setting DPI back to 100%, and rebooting – that cured it.</p>
