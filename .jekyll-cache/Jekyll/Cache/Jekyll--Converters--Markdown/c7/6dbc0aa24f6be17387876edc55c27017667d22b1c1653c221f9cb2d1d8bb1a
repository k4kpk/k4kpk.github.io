<p>Note: This is on the Cherokee reservation.  Ask permission at the campground, it is open May 15 - Oct 15.</p>

<p><strong>ALERT</strong>: There is a <a href="https://www.sota.org.uk/Article/W4C/WM-013/21367">2017 report</a> that they are now hostile to summit hikers. I recommend against sneaking up in the off season.  I‚Äôve heard Cherokee courts are unsympathetic to trespassers.  In 2015, when I activated, I asked at the camp office and they said, ‚ÄúSure.  Go ahead.‚Äù</p>

<ul>
  <li>Best route:
    <ul>
      <li>Go 1 mile on Heintooga past</li>
      <li>L onto unnamed dirt road at at sign for Mile High Campground and go 0.3.</li>
      <li>At 5-way intersection:
        <ul>
          <li>Do not take the acute L (downhill).  This is BIA 407 back to Heintooga.</li>
          <li>Do not take the acute R.  This leads into campsites.</li>
          <li>90-degree left turn leads to office (slight uphill).  There are signs when the camp is open. Go there and ask permission.</li>
          <li>90-degree right turn (passing between green shed and shower building) leads to trailhead.  Park in the grass strip (inside the hairpin) where road makes hairpin turn L.<br />
There‚Äôs a gate on the path to the summit (not across BIA 407).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Poor route - Immediately after turning onto Heintooga, bear L on twisty dirt road (BIA 407) up to campground.</li>
</ul>

<p>The 5-way intersection in the middle of the camp:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There‚Äôs a speed bump on the driveway back to Heintooga.</li>
  <li>There‚Äôs a sign as you come into camp that says to drive slow.  On the back of this sign (visible from mid-intersection), there‚Äôs hand-lettered ‚ÄúExit‚Äù on the left side of the sign and a wiggly line on the right side.  This tells you that the road to the left is the driveway back to Heintooga, and the road to the right is the twisty-windy BIA 407 leg back to Heintooga.</li>
  <li>There‚Äôs a speed bump on the leg of BIA 407 that leads to the trailhead.  (This is the road between the green shed and the shower building.)</li>
</ul>
