<p>Commentary:
I activated Tray Mountain (W4G/NG-005) and Rocky Mountain (W4G/NG-011) on Friday, May 31.</p>

<p>Tray Mountain:</p>

<p>I parked in the Tray Gap parking area, where Tray Mountain Rd passes nearest to Tray Mountain, and where it meets Corbin Creek Rd.  (Thereâ€™s a gate at the entrance to Corbin Creek Rd â€“ it was open.)</p>

<p>The morning was foggy with intermittent drizzle.  I couldnâ€™t see much from Tray.  I set up with my KX3 and an AlexLoop almost on top of the benchmark.  I had no trouble getting out SMS messages and APRS messages.  (There was lots of APRS traffic.)  I didnâ€™t make any 40m contacts.  I made only a few 20m contacts.  The propagation forecast was â€œGoodâ€ for 80-20m.  I donâ€™t know whether actual propagation was poor, not many chasers were active, or my antenna wasnâ€™t getting out.</p>

<p>The summit is mostly patches of granite with some dwarf trees and rhododendron.  If youâ€™re a fan of self-supporting antennas (such as the AlexLoop on a tripod), this is a good site to use them.</p>

<p>The route to Tray is easy â€“ just follow the AT blazes.  Tray Mountain is in the eponymously named Tray Mountain Wilderness.  Youâ€™ll pass by a big sign enumerating Wilderness Area rules.  No mention of any limits on amateur radio. ;-)  It is not a particularly difficult hike.</p>

<p>As I returned to the parking area, a family drove up Corbin Creek Rd and parked.  The family and their dog piled out for a day in the woods.  As I was leaving, I saw them puzzling over a large map.  That kinda puzzled me:  The AT is clearly marked, it goes <em>up</em> to Tray Mountain and <em>down</em> to Indian Grave Gap; thereâ€™s no other trail in the gap.</p>

<p>Rocky Mountain:</p>

<p>I parked at Indian Grave Gap.  The AT crossing is well marked and thereâ€™s a good sized parking area.  There is a side trail to the Andrews Cove campground at Highway 17.</p>

<p>The walk up Rocky is longer than Tray, and it has many stone steps.  It is hard on the knees coming down.  There are some pretty views near the top. I might have missed the side trail to the summit, had my GPS not chimed that Iâ€™d arrived.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s a pretty (but dry) campsite on the summit.  Plenty of space for guying an antenna and nice trees to hang a wire.  Thereâ€™s shaded grassy space near the fire circle and a pine straw covered tent pad.</p>

<p>Driving:</p>

<p>Tray Mountain Road was drivable in my Corolla.  It wasnâ€™t bad, but there are some erosion gullies and potholes which might be a problem if it degrades much more before maintenance happens.  Indian Grave Gap Road is a <em>little</em> better shape, and it is definitely a shorter drive.  The ford on Indian Grave Gap road wasnâ€™t a problem, but there hadnâ€™t been significant rainfall for several days.  (Climbing out from the creek is a bit steep, so be sure not to come to a stop in mid-creek, so youâ€™ll have some momentum.)</p>
