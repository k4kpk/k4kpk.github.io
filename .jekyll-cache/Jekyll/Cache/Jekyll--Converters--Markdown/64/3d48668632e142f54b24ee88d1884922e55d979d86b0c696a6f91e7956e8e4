<p>Commentary:</p>

<p>Woody Gap is on GA-60, and easy to find.  Lots of parking, but lots of hikers/bikers/picnickers on weekends.</p>

<p>If you go there, watch out! There‚Äôs lots of poison ivy on that summit.  I went off trail, to activate from the true high point.  There was lots of thunderstorm QRN, but a good number of chasers persisted through the noise and my weak signal.</p>

<p>Given the poison ivy and the fact that the high point of the <strong>trail</strong> is within the activation zone, I‚Äôll operate from the side of the trail when I go back.   I was observed by a doe for part of my activation, so that was unusual.</p>
