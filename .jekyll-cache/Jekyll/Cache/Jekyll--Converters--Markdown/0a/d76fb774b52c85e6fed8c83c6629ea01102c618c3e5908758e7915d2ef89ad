<p><strong>Hey coachâ€¦ I heard that contests are a problem for SOTA activators, and I shouldnâ€™t activate on a contest weekend.  Is that true?</strong></p>

<p>Not really true.  Number one â€“ Thereâ€™s a contest almost every weekend.  You canâ€™t avoid them.  Number two â€“ Only the really big contests could be a problem.  So letâ€™s talk about what to do about the really big contests.</p>

<ul>
  <li>One option is to retreat to the WARC bands.  Contesting isnâ€™t done on WARC bands.  SOTA isnâ€™t a contest.  (It is an â€œawards program.â€)  So you can use 17 meters or, if you can do CW, you can use 30 meters.</li>
  <li>One option is to get in there and compete with the contest.  Find yourself an unused frequency and go to town as a typical activation.</li>
  <li>If you canâ€™t beat â€˜em, join â€˜em.  Participate in the contest.  Many contests want you to exchange call sign, signal report, and sequence number.  If you donâ€™t generally do contests, that means youâ€™ll say something like, â€œW1ABC you are number 1 and you are 599â€ for your first contest QSO, and then, â€œW2XYZ you are number 2 and you are 599â€ for your second QSO.  Some contests want you to state your county and the other guy will give you his state.  (These are called â€œQSO parties.â€)  The gentlemanly thing to do when you get home is to record your QSOs on the contest site, in addition to the SOTAdata site.  It isnâ€™t hard â€“ really.  Just listen to what the other contesters are doing, and imitate them.</li>
  <li>Change modes.  Most contests use CW one weekend and SSB another weekend.  Whichever mode they are using, you use another.</li>
  <li>Do a VHF activation.  Get on your HT and raise contacts on 146.52.</li>
</ul>

<p>The one thing you canâ€™t avoid about a contact is that some of your regular chasers will be busy with the contest and they wonâ€™t be chasing.  So donâ€™t expect a million QSOs if youâ€™re competing with Sweepstakes.  Ohâ€¦ and if you activate on the day <em>after</em> a big contest, some of your chasers will be sleeping after contesting for 24 hours straight, so your QSO count will be down.</p>

<p>Contests can add to the difficulty factor.  In my first 40 activations, I had <strong>one</strong> activation where I had to work really hard to make 4 QSOs, and I eventually joined the contest to make my 4th.  Iâ€™ve had activations where Iâ€™ve been working my chasers and a contester started calling CQ on top of me.  Other than that, contests havenâ€™t been a big problem.</p>

<p>Note: The contester who called on top of me may have been rude, but he might not have heard me.  Remember that Iâ€™m running 12 watts and he was probably running a kilowatt.  If heâ€™s running a kilowatt into a puny antenna, he could be an alligator (with a big mouth and little ears).</p>
