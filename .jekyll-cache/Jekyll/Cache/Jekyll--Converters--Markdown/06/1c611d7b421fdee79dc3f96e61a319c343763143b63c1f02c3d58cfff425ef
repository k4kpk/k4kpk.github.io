I"R+<p>I’m studying for the Amateur Extra Class license exam.  I want to pass, but I’m not seeking a perfect score.  (Perfection is not an effective use of my time.)  I’m willing to memorize facts but not answers.  The difference is that a fact is something useful after the exam.</p>

<p>However, I will memorize an occasional answer or write-off a question if the amount of learning is enormous just to answer a few questions.</p>

<p>These are just the things I have to learn.  I’m not capturing things I already know, such as Ohms law.</p>

<p>https://hamstudy.org/extra2012 (the “Read Questions” link) is very helpful.  Many of the questions have explanations associated with the answers.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reminder: micro and mega both deal with a million (10<strong>6).  Pico is million million (10</strong>12).</li>
  <li><strong>Circulator</strong> - a three- or four-port device, in which an RF signal entering any port is transmitted to the next port in rotation (only).</li>
  <li>Receiver performance measures
    <ul>
      <li>MDS = Minimum Discernable Signal</li>
      <li><strong>Dynamic range</strong> = space between weakest signal radio can receive and strongest it can handle w/o excess distortion.</li>
      <li><strong>Desense</strong> (a.k.a. blocking) = close frequency at strong level drives RF amp to compression (non-linear behavior).
        <ul>
          <li>Narrowing receiver bandwidth reduces this because “close” means within the receiver passband.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Cross-modulation</strong> = modulation of a close frequency superimposes on desired frequency.</li>
      <li>Phase noise in the local oscillator of a receiver can mix with nearby frequencies to interfere with the tuned frequency.  (It creates a signal that mixes with the nearby frequency.)</li>
      <li>Blocking Dynamic Range = dB between noise floor and incoming signal level which will cause 1 dB of gain compression.  In effect, it is the signal strength range the receiver can handle.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Intermodulation
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Intermodulation products</strong> are the emissions at frequencies generated by the combination of two or more frequencies <strong>in a non-linear device</strong>, such as the output stage of a transmitter, or the input stage of a receiver (or corroded connections).  E.g. (f1 - 2*f2).  Mixing often occurs in a non-linear RF amp.</li>
      <li>A circulator reduces intermod by preventing signals received in the transmitting antenna going back into the transmitter amplifier and mixing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>3rd order intercept
    <ul>
      <li>a 3rd order intercept of x db means that a pair of signals will theoretically generate a third-order intermodulation product with the same level as the input signals</li>
      <li>3rd order intermod products created within a receiver are of interest because the 3rd order product of two signals in the band of interest is also likely to be within the band</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Resonance
    <ul>
      <li>At resonance, the L and C components of an RLC circuit go to zero, leaving only R.</li>
      <li>In <em>series</em>, when L and C cancel, you have lower total RLC impedance, so more current flows.  (This is like removing 2 of 3 resistors that are in a series. R goes down.)</li>
      <li>In <em>parallel</em>, when L and C cancel, you have higher impedance between the two rails, so less current flows.  (This is like removing 2 of 3 resistors that are in parallel. R goes <strong>up</strong>.)</li>
      <li>L and/or C shift the phase between voltage and current in opposite directions.  Ergo, at resonance, there is no shift because AC circuits that are resistive have no phase shift.</li>
      <li>F = .159 / sqrt(LC)
        <ul>
          <li>Note: This is true when the units on L and C are similar.  (e.g. Farads and henries, or micro-farads and micro-henries.)  On the exam, they mix micro-henries with pico-farads, so you use: F = 1000 * .159 / sqrt(LC).
            <ul>
              <li>i.e. On the exam, calculate <strong>F = .159 / sqrt(LC)</strong> without regard for units, and then multiply by 1,000</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Time constant
    <ul>
      <li>One time constant = all but 37%.
        <ul>
          <li>e.g. Discharging to 37% in one time constant.</li>
          <li>e.g. Charging to all but 37% (meaning charged to 63%) in one time constant.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Calculating a time constant: T = RC
        <ul>
          <li>On the test, if you forget, pick the answer that is closest to the microfarad value (for all calculate-the-TC questions)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Q
    <ul>
      <li>Half_Power_Bandwidth = Frequency / Q.   [B = F/Q]
        <ul>
          <li>e.g. If Q = 10, and Frequency = 10 MHz, then Bandwidth = 1MHz.</li>
          <li>e.g. If Q = 95, and Frequency = 1.8 MHz, then Bandwidth = 1.8 / 95 = 0.0189 MHz = 18.9 KHz.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>The symbol for Nxxx is a little circle at the tip of AND / OR / no-op</li>
      <li>XOR (and XNOR) have a double line at the input side.  e.g. <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/XOR_ANSI.svg/100px-XOR_ANSI.svg.png" height="16" width="20" /></li>
