    <ul>
      <li>Do NOT try the route following Ramsey Prong.  From http://www.whiteblaze.net/forum/archive/index.php/t-54422.html (March 18, 2013), “I have hiked Ramsey Prong from the trail to the AT on Guyot… in 2005, there was absolutely no evidence of a manway on either side of the creek… the vegetation is prohibitively thick on both sides of the creek for pack-wearing travel… I resorted to creek-walking, which came with its own hazards but was faster than bushwhacking… being young, fit, and an experienced hiker, it took me seventeen hours to make it from Ramsey Cascade to the AT at Ramsey Prong… unrelentingly dense vegetation… for the entire length of the trip.”</li>
      <li>Cosby campground:
  	* Except for holiday weekends, tent sites are almost always available. Call 423-487-2683 to check on availability. (http://www.reserveamerica.com/camping/cosby-campground/r/campgroundDetails.do?contractCode=NRSO&amp;parkId=70960)
