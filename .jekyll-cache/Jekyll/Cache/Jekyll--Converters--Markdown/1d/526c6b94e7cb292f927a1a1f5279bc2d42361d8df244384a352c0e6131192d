<p>Commentary:
Today was a good day that almost didnâ€™t happen.  The propagation forecast was awful this morning, describing day and night conditions as â€œPoorâ€ on 20 meters and below, and only â€œFairâ€ on 17 and 15.  (A weak geomagnetic storm with S4-S6 noise level.)  There was a 40% chance of a thundershower when I was scheduled to hit the trailhead.  Instead of hitting snooze on the alarm clock, I decided to head out and learn what really poor propagation was like.  To misquote Twain, â€œReports of the death of propagation have been greatly exaggerated.â€</p>

<p>Geography matters.</p>

<p>Rabun Bald has a 20â€™ stone tower at the top, so the base of my antenna was 20â€™ up.  Given the propagation forecast, I used a random end-fed in order to be frequency agile.  No need.  I had good propagation on 20 and made a couple of strong contacts on 40.</p>

<p>While I was atop the tower, about 20 people cycled through.  One commented, â€œWe should ask him to give us a little talk.â€  That was all the encouragement I needed in order to launch into my SOTA spiel.</p>

<p>Afterward, I headed over to Black Rock Mountain.  My operating position was on a narrow ridge.  (Narrow by Appalachian standards, not Rocky Mountain standards.)  Since the morning showed that I wouldnâ€™t need to run up to a higher frequency, I used a half-wave on 20m and a quarter wave on 40m.  I had grand success on 20, but made no contacts on 40.  There was quite a bit of thunderstorm noise on 40, but I donâ€™t think I was getting out well.  I added a single radial on 40m.  <em>I</em> thought of it as a radial.  In retrospect, I expect that RF thought I had a dipole with the mid-point at ground level.  (When I used a single radial for 40m this morning, given the height of my tower, that raised my mid-point to 20â€™.)</p>

<p>Iâ€™m going to have to start carrying more wire to operate on 40 meters.</p>

<p>A small black-and-yellow lizard sat by my boot and observed most of my session on Black Rock Mountain.  He skittered off when I got up to pack up.  He didnâ€™t say whether he had his license, so I didnâ€™t offer to let him operate.</p>

<p>Thank you chasers!</p>
