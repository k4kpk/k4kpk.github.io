I"1<p>I’m a fan of the N0SA mini-paddle, for SOTA CW use.  It is lightweight, has a good feel… and it is supported by N0SA.  He calls them “SSP Mini Paddles” and they are aluminum and steel.</p>

<p>Like all paddles with steel-posts and aluminum arms, I have trouble with developing a high-resistance connection between the pin and the arm/paddle, particularly after a period of non-use.  So I decided to pull the arm off.  To do so meant removing a c-clip.</p>

<p>I carefully wrapped my left hand around the paddle and pulled the clip off with a sharp, pointy tool.  The clip bounced off my hand and was gone forever in the clutter of my shack.</p>

<p>I wrote to N0SA and asked him if I could buy a replacement – or several, since I’ll have to clean it again someday.  He was kind enough to mail me 3 at no charge!</p>

<p>… and if anyone needs to buy replacements, they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>McMaster Carr Part number 98408A114</li>
  <li>Side-Mount External Retaining Rings, 3/32” O.D., for an 0.074” groove, made from 15-7 PH stainless steel</li>
</ul>
