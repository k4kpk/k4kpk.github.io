<p>I operate <em>primarily</em> on 20 meters.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll generally give 40 meters a try, since it is supposed to reach a local geography which 20 doesnâ€™t.  (I havenâ€™t actually found that to be the case, but it could be because Iâ€™m doing it wrong.)  If thereâ€™s a big contest, Iâ€™ll look for an open frequency on 17 meters.</p>

<p>My first choice is 20, because itâ€™s where I find daytime DX and it is so much <strong>quieter</strong> than 40.</p>

<p>Most hills I operate on have trees; most also have space (and dirt) to guy out an antenna.</p>

<p>I like EFHW because I donâ€™t have to mess with radials.  On the hill, simple is better.  I also like EFHW because the low current at the feed point reduces ground loss which youâ€™d get even <strong>with</strong> radials.</p>

<h1 id="in-the-beginning">In the beginningâ€¦</h1>
<p>At first, I carried a 31â€™ Jackite pole for an EFHW for 20 meters.  Iâ€™ve got pre-cut rope and 3 stakes.    If thereâ€™s a convenient tree stump, I use a bungee cord.  If there is a convenient tree branch, I might simply lean the pole against it, if wind is calm.  I use painterâ€™s tape to stick my wire to the pole in about 4 spots.  I can erect a 20 meter EFHW on a Jackite in about 5 minutes without assistance.</p>

<p>When Iâ€™m on site, I love my Jackite.  Getting to the site, I hate it.  It its collapsed form, it is taller than my pack.  Iâ€™ve created a special holder, so it can hang down below my pack, and it still gets caught on overhead branches.  I donâ€™t mind the weight.  I donâ€™t mind the thick diameter.  That length is just plain awful.</p>

<h1 id="slings-and-arrows">Slings and Arrowsâ€¦</h1>
<p>I tried using a slingshot to launch an antenna support into the trees.</p>

<p>The first time went great.  Since then, Iâ€™ve had some successes and some failures.  Some days I just canâ€™t get off a good shot.  When it works, it is OK, but it often takes longer than Iâ€™d like.</p>

<p>Using a 3/4â€ nut was awful.  I kept hitting the upright of the slingshot when I tried to shoot it.  Iâ€™m now using a 1 oz. â€œegg sinker,â€ and that seems to work pretty well.  Since Iâ€™m using a heavy line, Iâ€™m also going to try a 2 oz weight.</p>

<p>One key to successful slingshooting is to put the spool of fishing line on the ground in <em>front</em> of where you stand, face up.  That seems to give the weight time to clear the upright before the downward tug of the line affects the flight path.  I still sometimes get a tangle of monofilament.</p>

<p>I used to send up fishing line and use that to pull up a stouter cord.  Now, I just use 30 pound test monofilament.  It is strong enough to support my wire.  It is cheap enough that I donâ€™t bother reusing it.  I just cut it out of the tree when Iâ€™m finished, tie it in a knot, and trash it when I get home.  Since my line gets shorter and shorter, someday Iâ€™ll shoot the weight and it will pull the end of the line off.  Iâ€™ll cross that bridge when I come to it.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve avoided the carbon fiber fishing poles from www.allfishingbuy.com because I did some testing with carbon fiber, and it looked like maybe it attenuated my signal a little.  It is hard to tell when testing with RBN because so many variables are uncontrollable.  (i.e. The data is full of statistical noise.)</p>

<p>Some people have been very happy with these poles, so Iâ€™m going to give them another try.  I bought a nominal 24â€™ pole that collapses into 25â€.  (Warning: The nominal 24â€™ pole is actually about 23â€™!)  25â€ is good because I also carry a 24â€ foam pad (rolled up) as a sitting/operating mat, and I can roll it around the collapsed mast.</p>

<p>Instead of erecting a straight vertical EFHW, Iâ€™m going to shoot for a 33â€™ inverted L.  The idea is to put a weight (and maybe some monofilament) on the far end of the antenna wire.  Iâ€™ll use the pole to toss the weight/line over a suitable tree branch, and then Iâ€™ll bungee or guy the mast a few horizontal yards away.</p>

<p>Iâ€™d like to put the end of the antenna far enough away that the bottom of the antenna wire gets pulled about 6 feet up the mast.  Iâ€™m using an EARCHI â€˜matchboxâ€™ transformer at the end of the wire, and Iâ€™ll zip tie that to the mast at the end of the wire.  Then Iâ€™ll run about 8â€™ of coax to my radio.</p>

<p>I put 34â€™ of 24 gauge teflon insulated wire on a camping clothesline spool.  I use that as my antenna.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ll see if I continue to get enough contacts.  It doesnâ€™t have to be the <em>best</em> antenna.  It just has to be an adequate antenna that is fast and dependable to setup â€“ even on a hill with dense tree cover, dense underbrush, snow cover, and ice frozen on the underbrush.  (Been there.  Done that.)</p>

<h1 id="what-about-40">What About 40?</h1>
<p>Iâ€™ve been using the 20m EARCHI matchbox to match the high impedance at the end of my EFHW.  While this works well on 20 meters, when I use the same 33-34 foot wire on 40 meters, I get a quarter wave antenna, with no radials, and the matchbox which is designed to work about 3000 ohm impedance is getting handed about 50.  Iâ€™ve made contacts, but my signal is weak.</p>

<p>I know from experience that using a 20m EFHW without a matchbox with my KX3 gets me a 4:1 SWR.  This suggests that my KX3 tuner can <strong>almost</strong> tune an EFHW.  So my plan is to use the EARCHI 6-40 matchbox, which is a 9:1 balun on both 20 and 40 meters.  The 9:1 will get me past the 4:1 with an EFHW, and it wonâ€™t be too hard for the ATU to tune it in the other direction it on 40.  So Iâ€™ll hook up the 33â€™ wire to the 6-40 balun without a counterpoise on 20 (it is an EFHW), and when I switch to 40 Iâ€™ll clamp a 30â€™ counterpoise to the shield connector of the feed line.</p>

<p>I could just use a non-resonant wire length with the 6-40 matchbox on all frequencies, and use a counterpoise always, but I like having the option of running the EFHW without a counterpoise if Iâ€™m running late when I arrive at the site.  On occasions when I want to get the best possible signal, Iâ€™ll use the 20m matchbox on 20, and remove the matchbox entirely on 40 (and use a BNC to binding post adapter to connect the antenna and the counterpoise to the KX3).</p>
