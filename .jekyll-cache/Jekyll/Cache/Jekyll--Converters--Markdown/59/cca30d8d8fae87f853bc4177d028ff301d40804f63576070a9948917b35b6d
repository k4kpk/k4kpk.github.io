I"»<p>Some hams don‚Äôt partipate in SOTA out of a mistaken notion that they don‚Äôt have the necessary equipment/skill/physique.  Let‚Äôs look at some things you do NOT need in order to participate in SOTA.</p>

<p>In order to be an activator, you do NOT need</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>10,000‚Äô mountains</strong>. Even Mississippi has a SOTA summit.  It is a lofty 730‚Äô at the summit.  Georgia has over 130 summits, with none reaching 4800‚Äô.</li>
  <li><strong>An SUV with 4-wheel drive</strong>.  Many trailheads are accessible via paved highways.  Others are accessible via roads in good condition.  Some do require 4WD, but one hame made it to 74 different summits in the southeast in an ‚Äòall-terrain‚Äô Corolla.</li>
  <li><strong>Topographic maps, bushwhacking or mountain-climbing skill</strong>.  There are detailed directions on how to reach <em>many</em> summits.  Most of those summits are accessible via clear hiking trails.  Some are reached 100% via <em>roads</em>.  A few will require a bushwhack.</li>
  <li><strong>Hiking boots</strong>.  Boots <em>are</em> nice for some trails.  However, some ‚Äòtrails‚Äô are paved and others are a short walk on an easy trail, and sneakers are plenty good.  Some of the most remote summits in Georgia have been reached in nothing more than 5 year-old jogging shoes.</li>
  <li><strong>Good physical conditioning</strong>.  If you‚Äôre thinking, ‚ÄúI really need to get in better shape before I try activating,‚Äù consider a drive-up or a nearly drive-up summit.  If you can participate in Field Day, you‚Äôve got the stamina to activate several summits in the southeast.  There are summits you can activate even if you‚Äôre in a wheelchair!  (Email me if you‚Äôre in this category and you want to know how.)</li>
  <li><strong>An expensive specialty radio</strong>.  If you own a solid-state rig and you can carry it and a battery across a parking lot, you‚Äôve got the radio you need.  You can activate many summits with nothing more than an HT.  If you‚Äôre a CW operator, you can activate with a ‚ÄúTuna Tin‚Äù or other cheap kit.  Shucks - you don‚Äôt even really need to own a radio.  Email an activator and ask if you can tag along on an activation and use his radio.</li>
  <li><strong>An entire day</strong>.  If you‚Äôre in the Atlanta area, there are at least 3 different summits which could be activated in a morning or an afternoon.  (If you‚Äôve <em>got</em> a whole summer day, you could go for the full set!)</li>
  <li><strong>CW skills</strong>.  There are activators who reach Mountain Goat using SSB.</li>
  <li><strong>Fast CW skills</strong>. I struggle at 13 WPM.  There are guys who go out at 10 WPM.  You might put off a few chasers at 5 WPM, but I‚Äôd be surprised if you couldn‚Äôt get 4 chasers at 5 WPM if you have a strong signal.</li>
  <li><strong>Great operating skill</strong>.  My first QSO was a SOTA activation.  I can assure you (as can the chasers) that I was inept.  (Shucks, I‚Äôm barely ‚Äòept‚Äô now.)</li>
  <li><strong>A fancy antenna</strong>.  If you have a tuner or an ATU, just throw 29‚Äô of wire in a tree and lay out a similar counterpoise.  One of the most popular SOTA antennas is an EFHW, such as the <a href="http://www.lnrprecision.com/endfedz/trail-friendly/">PAR Trail-friendly</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>A General Class license</strong>.  There are  successful VHF activators.</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to be a chaser, you do NOT need</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>A beam at 60‚Äô</strong>.  OK.  I‚Äôll admit that this <em>helps</em>.  However, you can be a successful chaser with an NVIS on 40 meters.  With a better antenna, you can chase activators around the world.  With a lesser antenna, you just stick to activators closer to home.</li>
  <li><strong>CW</strong> (or <strong>SSB</strong>).  There are activators who work strictly CW, activators who work strictly USB, and there are activators who work both.  You‚Äôll have more opportunity if you can run both.  You‚Äôll even find a <em>few</em> activators who can work PSK31 or RTTY.  (There are some CW-only activators, because the <a href="http://www.lnrprecision.com/store/#!/Mountain-Topper/p/45010523/category=10468544">smallest radios</a> are CW-only.)</li>
  <li><strong>Fast CW skills</strong>.  A slow chaser will struggle more than a slow activator.  If the activator calls CQ at 10 WPM, everyone answers at 10 WPM.  If you‚Äôre a slow-CW chaser and you tune in to a 25 WPM activation, you‚Äôre not going to be able to tell who‚Äôs who.  But‚Ä¶ Pick up the activator‚Äôs call sign from SOTAWatch, and just wait until the beeping mostly stops, and send your call sign at your speed.  Most activators will respond at your speed.  (Some of them have keyers that make this tough, so you might get fast characters with BIG spacing.)</li>
  <li><strong>A General Class license</strong> or <strong>an HF rig</strong>.  (See activator non-needs.)  If you‚Äôre chasing VHF or 10 meters, be sure and contact the activator in advance, and ask him to work your band.  If you have a VHF beam 30‚Äô AGL in north Georgia, you could be a <em>very</em> popular chaser.  There is a shortage of chasers working VHF in this area, and there are activators who would love to carry only an HT.</li>
  <li><strong>A ham license</strong>.  What??!!  It‚Äôs true.  There is an SWL category in SOTA for non-hams.</li>
</ul>

<p>No excuses!  You have what you need to participate in SOTA.</p>

<p>See you on the summits!
