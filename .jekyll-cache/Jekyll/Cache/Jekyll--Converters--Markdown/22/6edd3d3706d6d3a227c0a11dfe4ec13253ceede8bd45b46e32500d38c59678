</ul>

<p>Commentary:</p>

<p>Perfect weather, convenient site to Atlanta, moderate-level hike. For a bonus, my eldest son came along and listened in via a second set of headphones. We both had a great time.</p>

<p>It’s a short, steep hike up from the west parking lot off Komatsu Drive in Cartersville. 20 meters was noise free and our chosen frequency was silent. (That’s an advantage of a weekday activation!)</p>

<p>Contacts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>11 QSO at 10 watts on 20 meters - 14.345 MHz SSB</li>
  <li>Thank you chasers!</li>
</ul>

<p>Radio: Elecraft KX3.</p>

<ul>
  <li>This is the first time I managed to get battery power and SWR just right to transmit with 10 watts. (Nothing wrong with the radio before this – just operator error.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Antenna I used:</p>

<ul>
  <li>20 meters - EFHW on 31’ Jackite with EARCHI 20 meter matchbox. Bungee-corded it to the trunk of a twisted tree.</li>
  <li>I used a counterpoise of about 21-20 feet.</li>
</ul>
