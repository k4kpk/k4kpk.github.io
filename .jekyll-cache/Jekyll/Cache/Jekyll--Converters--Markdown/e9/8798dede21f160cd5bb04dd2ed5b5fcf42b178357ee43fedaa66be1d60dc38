I"†<p>My KX3 volume is too low.  When I crank up the volume to the max level, it is sometimes barely loud enough to hear.  Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s been suggested (and Iâ€™m working on testing).</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the AGC menu adjust AGC THR (AGC threshold).</li>
  <li>Tap the TUNE button.</li>
  <li>Turn off NR.</li>
  <li>Check RF gain.  (Did that.  It is at max = 0.  Lower levels are negative.)</li>
  <li>Turn preamp on.</li>
  <li>Make sure you donâ€™t have an antenna problem.</li>
  <li>Swap between headphones and speaker.  (Iâ€™ve been using headphones.  The speaker will show me whether it is a problem with headphone sensitivity.)</li>
</ul>
