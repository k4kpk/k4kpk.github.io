<p>I like LMR-200 (a.k.a. LMR200).  It is lightweight. It is much lower loss than RG-174 or LMR-100A.  I’ve had zero durability problems with it, after a couple hundred SOTA activations.</p>

<p>The only down-side is that it is stiff, but I can coil it into a big circle and slide it into my backpack first, and it fits.</p>

<p>If I ever set up a home station, I’ll probably use LMR-400 because it is sligtly lower loss and the extra weight isn’t a problem at home.  (It is <em>stiff</em> as the devil though.)</p>
