I"D<p>I have this idea of having a library of SOTA trip plans on the metaphorical shelf.  When I think, “Hey! I could do a summit this weekend,” I’d like to reach up to the shelf, pull one out, and take off.  I might even color code them green/yellow/red for easy/medium/hard, and store them on the shelf in last-activated order from left to right.  So if I’m in the mood for a medium adventure, I’d pull out the left-most yellow, and get a medium summit that I haven’t done recently.</p>

<p>But I’m paperless to the extent possible.  So I’ll do something electronic.  And I’m analytically minded, so I’ll over-think it.</p>

<p>I have three types of info: Static, Public-dynamic, and Private-dynamic.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Static information includes checklists and reference material.  Static information is tied to me at my current skill level.  It changes very slowly, but it does sometimes change.</li>
  <li>Public-dynamic information includes things like driving directions to the trailhead.  This information is tied to the trip, and it is information that <strong>anyone</strong> making this trip from my neighborhood would need.  I call it ‘dynamic’ because the info is different for <em>this</em> trip than it was for <em>that</em> trip.</li>
  <li>Private-dynamic information is stuff that applies to the intersection of <em>me</em> and <em>this</em> trip.  It is stuff that only I will need for this trip.  Things like the crib notes I’ll use to go on-the-air on this summit, including my alert, my CQ call text (which I like to use to get me past the getting-started jitters).</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ll store content:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Static content in Circus Ponies Notebook.
    <ul>
      <li>It does checklists the way I like.</li>
      <li>If I publish it, I’ll do File/Export-as-website from Notebook.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Public-dynamic content in .mou (Markdown) files.
    <ul>
      <li>After my activation, I’ll paste this into a ‘SOTA Guide: xxx/yy-000, Summit_name, State_name’ story on my blog (or update my existing story, if it is a re-activation).</li>
      <li>(In addition to publishing/updating the Public-dynamic content, I’ll also publish a ‘SOTA Activation Report: xxx/yy-000 - Summit Name, State_name’ activation report, which is my commentary.  The activation report will include a link to the corresponding guide.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Private-dynamic content in Pages/Numbers (OS X office suite).  This has to go into an office suite because I want a textual document which contains a dynamically calculated table.  One of the pieces of my Private-dynamic content is a timeline, and I want to be able to update the on-the-air time and have it calculate when I have to get up in the morning and when I’ll get home afterward.</li>
</ul>
