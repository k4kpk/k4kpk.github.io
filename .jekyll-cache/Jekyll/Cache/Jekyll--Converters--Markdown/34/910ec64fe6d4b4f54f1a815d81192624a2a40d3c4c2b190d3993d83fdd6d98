<p>Commentary:</p>

<p>This was planned as the second summit of a double-header with Coosa Bald (W4G/NG-006).  I was too cold.  I activated Coosa and drove to the trailhead for Sheriff.  I even loaded up the pack and took a few steps, but I decided I couldnâ€™t safely activate the summit today and beat a retreat.</p>

<p>Commentary:</p>

<p>Activated as the middle summit in a triple-header with Gooch, Sheriff, then Coosa.  The climb up was intense.  There was a lot of brush/undergrowth.  It was do-able with the winter die-off, but I recommend against attempting this summit in the green (spring/summer) season.</p>

<p>There were points in the ascent where I had to keep moving forward, lest I slide back.  Many points where I planted my trekking poles and hauled myself up.  The route I took coming back down may be a little better than the hike up.</p>

<p>It was a sunny but windy day.  Both times I was at this trailhead, it seemed windier than the other summit(s).</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™ll try this summit again.  Very strenuous climb.</p>
