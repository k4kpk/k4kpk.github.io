<p>Commentary:</p>

<p>Clingmans Dome is one of the highest points east of the Mississippi.  The summit is a short walk up from the parking lot.  It has an observation tower at the summit.  I was not brash enough to attempt an activation from the tower, though I did activate within sight of it.  A number of young people asked me what I was doing.  I had an experience that I often have: When I say I‚Äôm an amateur radio operator, I get blank looks, but when I say, ‚ÄúI set up a radio station and I talk to people from around the world,‚Äù I get enthusiastic declarations of, ‚ÄúCool!‚Äù</p>

<p>Dark clouds were rolling in here, so I rushed through my activation again.</p>

<p>I set up my antenna near the ramp, at its farthest point from the observation deck.  Next time, I‚Äôd like to try getting away from the deck, as I wonder if it interfered with my signal.  Or maybe bring sound-deadening headphones and a narrator/protector and set up on top of the tower.</p>

<p>Thank you chasers for your patience!</p>
