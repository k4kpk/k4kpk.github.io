<p><em>Iâ€™m going to tag along on a SOTA activation as an observer.  What do I need to bring?</em></p>

<p>Just bring the usual items youâ€™d take for a hike in the mountains, plus something to sit on.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Water (to drink)</li>
  <li>Snack, if desired</li>
  <li>Sunscreen, bug dope, etc., if you need that sort of thing when youâ€™re outdoors</li>
  <li>Clothing suitable for the season.  Youâ€™ll work up a sweat getting to the summit.  Then youâ€™ll sit around for an hour or more.  Summits are often windy.  Bring a little more clothing than you think youâ€™ll need.</li>
  <li>Bring something to sit on.  You can bring a foam pad, or a small ground cloth, etc.  Youâ€™re going to sit on top of that mountain for an hour or more.  Some summits are rocky.  Some are covered with moist dirt.  Some are covered with poison ivy.</li>
  <li>Hiking staff, trekking poles, etc., if you use that sort of thing.  Remember that youâ€™ll be hiking up a mountain and then back down.  (Hiking down hurts my knees.)</li>
</ul>
