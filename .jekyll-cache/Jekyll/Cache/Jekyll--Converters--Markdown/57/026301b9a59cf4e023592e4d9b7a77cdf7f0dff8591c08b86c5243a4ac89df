  <li><strong>Directions</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Do NOT follow GPS or Google Maps onto Timberline Dr.  Google does not know of the road with the trailhead (January 2016).  See note below.</li>
      <li>The shortest route from north Atlanta is up GA-400 (1:50).  For some reason, Google Maps routed me up I-575 in early 2016. That route is a good 2:05 (+ 15 minutes of stops).</li>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Duration</strong>: 1:45 up; 1:30 down.</li>
  <li><strong>Navigation</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Named ‚ÄúMiller Trek Trail‚Äù.</li>
      <li>From day hiker parking lot, walk 200‚Äô farther on the road.  Follow the painted ‚ÄúT‚Äù markings through the narrow employee parking lot on the right, leading to the arch over the trailhead.</li>
      <li>Follow the green blazes.  It is a loop trail, but I went up and back the same (slightly shorter) right side, because I wanted to explore a side trail I saw on the way up.</li>
      <li>My GPX trace shows two detours.  The early part of the trail was an active stream, due to recent rains.  On the way up, I noticed a gate between the trail and paved roads.  On the way back, I walked around the gate and walked the paved roads of Brasstown resort, in order to avoid the wet end of the trail.  Also, on the way up, I noticed a water tank.  On the way back, I detoured to the water tank (and nearby on its road).  The water tank has a parking area marked ‚ÄúNFS Access for Rocky Knob Members and Guests.‚Äù  There‚Äôs a paved road there.  Property on one side of the road is Forest Service.  There were signs on the other side of the road marked ‚ÄúRocky Knob Lot 46‚Äù and ‚ÄúRocky Knob Lot 47‚Äù.  I think you could shortcut the hike by quite a bit if you could find where this road comes out, and if you were willing to park in a community of million dollar home sites.  It might be gated, but I did see a car drive out and back, as if the driver were touring the area.</li>
