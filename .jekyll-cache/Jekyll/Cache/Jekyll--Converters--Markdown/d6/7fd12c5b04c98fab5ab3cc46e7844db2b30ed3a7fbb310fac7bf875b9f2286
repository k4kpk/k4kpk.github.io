I"N!<p><strong>I’d like to try a SOTA activation; can I start with an easy hill?</strong>
 
This month’s column will cover some north Georgia summits which are particularly
suitable for tyro activators or for an experienced activator who is looking for
a relatively easy activation.</p>

<p>I make it a point to identify summits with restrooms; this is important if you
take your family along for the activation.  (One ham’s XYL sheltered in a privy
while he activated in sub-zero weather!)</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/content/sota-guide-w4ghc-003-stone-mountain">W4G/HC-003, Stone Mountain</a></p>

    <p>Stone Mountain is near Atlanta.  If you don’t want to walk up, you can ride
  the tram to the top. Due to terrain, it is a great location for a magnetic
  loop or other tripod-based antenna.  There <em>is</em> a tree in the activation
  zone, if you want to throw a wire into it, and you can always bungee a mast
  to a fence.</p>

    <p>This is a very reachable trailhead.  There are paved roads all the way to
  the trailhead.  You can get there via MARTA or Uber, if you’re determined.</p>

    <p>There are lots of tourists on top, but with some care, you can pick a spot
  that is not too busy.  If you can, take a partner.  He/she can answer
  questions from gawkers while you’re on the air.  Remember that you are an
  ambassador for SOTA, and that you will provide the first impression of SOTA
  to many onlookers.</p>

    <p>There are restrooms on the summit.</p>

    <p>Technicians: You should have plenty of VHF activity, given the proximity to
  Atlanta. Remember that you cannot make contacts via repeater for SOTA, but
  you can call up the repeater and ask hams to meet you on simplex for SOTA
  credit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/content/sota-guide-w4ghc-005-springer-mountain">W4G/HC-005, Springer Mountain</a></p>

    <p>Springer Mountain is famous for being the start of the Appalachian Trail.
  While it would be a long walk from Amicalola Falls State Park, there is a
  “back route” to the summit which is about a mile.  Since it is on the
  Appalachian Trail, the trail is well marked.</p>

    <p>There is a privy in the camping area, just prior to the summit.</p>

    <p>The road to the “back route” trailhead is dirt and some of it is bumpy.  It
  is drivable in most weather in a passenger sedan.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/content/sota-guide-w4ghc-036-pine-mountain">W4G/HC-036 Pine Mountain</a></p>

    <p><em>This</em> Pine Mountain is near Atlanta, with a modest hike.  It is very close
  to I-75, so it isn’t hard to find.  The trailhead is reachable via paved
  roads; the parking lot is gravel.</p>

    <p>Its chief selling point is that it is convenient to Atlanta and that the
  summit isn’t overrun with tourists, like Stone Mountain.  There are trees in
  the activation zone, so that makes “wire in a tree” antennas feasible.</p>

    <p>Technicians: You should have plenty of VHF activity, given the proximity to
  Atlanta. Remember that you cannot make contacts via repeater for SOTA, but
  you can call up the repeater and ask hams to meet you on simplex for SOTA

  <li>
    <p><a href="/content/sota-guide-w4ghc-043-vineyard-mountain">W4G/HC-043 Vineyard Mountain</a></p>

    <p>Its chief selling point is that it is convenient to Atlanta and that the
  summit isn’t overrun with tourists, like Stone Mountain.  There are trees in
  the activation zone, so that makes “wire in a tree” antennas feasible.</p>

    <p>The trailhead is accessible via paved roads.  It is in a recreation area, so
  there should be restrooms somewhere nearby, but I’ve never found them.</p>

    <p><a href="/content/sota-guide-w4gng-001-brasstown-bald">W4G/NG-001 Brasstown Bald</a></p>

    <p>Brasstown Bald is the highest point in Georgia.  There is a visitor center
  on top and an observation deck.  The parking lot is reachable via paved road
  and there is a shuttle van from the lot to the summit.</p>

    <p>There are restrooms on the summit and at the parking lot.</p>

    <p>You could use an HT from the observation deck, but I wouldn’t recommend
  trying HF from the deck.  <em>Someone</em> is bound to object to your antenna.
  There is a trail from the parking lot to the summit.  20 feet before this
  trail reaches the summit, there is a small, grassy lawn to the right (as you
  <em>ascend</em>).  You can guy a mast here, or throw a wire into the trees along
  the side of the lawn.</p>

    <p>There are lots of tourists on top.  If you can, take a partner.  He/she can
  answer questions from gawkers while you’re on the air.  Remember that you
  are an ambassador for SOTA, and that you will provide the first impression
  of SOTA to many onlookers.</p>

    <p>The shuttle and the center are run by a contractor (Cradle of Forestry).
  Its personnel were inquisitive when I was last there.  They wanted to be
  sure I was <em>amateur</em> and not commercial, but they weren’t a problem.  Please
  be nice to them so they’ll be nice to future hams.</p>

    <p><a href="/content/sota-guide-w4gng-020-wildcat-mountain">W4G/NG-020, Wildcat Mountain</a></p>

    <p>Wildcat Mountain is one of the non-urban summits nearest to Atlanta.  It is
  good for 8 points, and there’s a nice view near the summit.  The trailhead
  is accessible via paved road.</p>

    <p>With a modest drive and a modest hike, you can activate this one and get
  back to Atlanta is a half-day outing.  The trail is easy to follow, but
  parts are steep.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/content/sota-guide-w4gng-022-black-mountain">W4G/NG-022, Black Mountain</a></p>

    <p>Black Mountain is a modest drive from Dahlonega.  The ’trail’ is a gravel
  road that’s easy to follow.  There’s a fire tower on top, with a small
  grassy area that makes a good activation spot.</p>

    <p>Do NOT believe Google Maps about the location of the trailhead.  Google Maps
  mistakes a power line for a dirt road.  For the real trailhead, see my trail
  guide at the link for Black Mountain (above).</p>

    <p>There is a privy at the trailhead.</p>

    <p>Note that when the wind shifts, there’s a loose antenna on the tower that
  moves.  It creaks loudly.  This can be startling if you think you’re the
  only person on the summit and then you hear a loud creak.</p>

    <p>There’s a good barbecue place in Dahlonega, for your post-activation meal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/content/sota-guide-w4gng-027-black-rock-mountain">W4G/NG-027, Black Rock Mountain</a></p>

    <p>Black Rock Mountain (sometimes spelled Blackrock Mountain) is north of
  Clayton, Georgia.  It is Georgia’s highest state park.  The trailhead is
  accessible via paved roads.  The trail is steep, but it is less than a mile
  to the activation zone.</p>

    <p>You can go all the way to the summit, but Tennessee Rock, shortly before the
  summit, is in the activation zone and it has a nicer view.</p>

    <p>The trail can be confusing.  During peak tourist season, there is sometimes
  a park employee at the parking area, handing out trail maps.  Take one!
  Also, see my trail guide at the Black Rock Mountain link (above).</p>

    <p>There are restrooms near the trailhead, but they’re a bit far to walk.</p>

<p>See you on the summits!
