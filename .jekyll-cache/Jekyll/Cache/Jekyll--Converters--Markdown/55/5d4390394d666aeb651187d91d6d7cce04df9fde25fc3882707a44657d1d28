I"Ã<p>Because â€œspace weather,â€ caused by events on the sun, impacts radio propagation, some people like to check the propagation forecast before heading out on a SOTA activation.  There are a number of sites which put together a forecast.  Iâ€™ve embedded some of them at my <a href="/content/radio-happiness-forecast">Radio Happiness Forecast page</a>.</p>

<p>This page is ironically named.  So far, Iâ€™ve found little value in the propagation forecast.  Iâ€™ve had bad days when the forecast was good and vice versa.  Despite the fact they are caled â€œforecasts,â€ they really report on how propagation should be <strong>right now</strong>.  The values change between the time I leave the house at 6 A.M. and when I activate the summit at 1 P.M. (for example).</p>

<p>There are other important variables when youâ€™re transmitting atop a mountain which can outweigh the propagation forecast.  For example, Iâ€™ve found that a sharply defined apex seems to really boost signal strength (with the antennas I use), and a broad, flat summit seems to attenuate.</p>

<p>Clearly, you wonâ€™t make transoceanic contact if the propagation isnâ€™t there, butâ€¦  If the forecast is poor, donâ€™t let that stop you from heading out the door.  If the forecast is great, but you really didnâ€™t want to activate today, donâ€™t go just because the forecast is good.  Iâ€™ve had great results at 11 A.M. when the forecast was poor at 6 A.M.  Note that Iâ€™ve not yet attempted an activation when the forecast was for heavy blackouts due to a major CME.</p>

<p>Check the <strong>weather</strong> forecast, and cancel your trip if it is going to rain on your activation, but donâ€™t let a bad solar weather forecast cancel your trip.</p>
