<p>Commentary:</p>

<p>Weather forecast for the day was 50% chance of thundershowers.  It didnâ€™t rain on this summit, but it had rained earlier and the vegetation was very wet.  The trail was overgrown with foliage, so I was soaked from the waist down when I reached the summit.</p>

<p>It is a short hike, at 1/2 mile from parking at FS64/Conasauga Lake Rd to the summit.  While it is definitely a climb, overall I rank it among the easiest hikes for Georgia 10-pointers.  Given the undergrowth, this would be a nice summit for early spring or late fall.  (Just watch out for the January-February closing of the road.)</p>

<p>On the way up, I chatted briefly with N4C, a special event station honoring the Battle of Chattanooga, but I was unable to raise him or anyone else on 2 meters from the summit.</p>

<p>I used a Telco Norcal Doublet at 15â€™ AGL.  (It was made from flat, 4-conductor phone cable, but otherwise it was identical to the â€˜officialâ€™ Norcal Doublet.)  Compared with my typical end-fed, it was a bother to set up, since I had to fly the center and both ends.  Since it was low to the ground, my distant chasers gave me weak signal reports, but I was able to work my local contacts on 20m.  All-in-all, I think an untuned doublet works surprisingly well; it is such a bother to set up, I donâ€™t know whether Iâ€™ll use it often.  OTOH, if the alternative is flying one antenna for 20m and another for 40m, it isnâ€™t so bad.</p>

<p>Multiple chasers complained that there was lots of noise on the bands today.  I am grateful that they put up with the noise and my weak signal.  Thank you chasers!</p>
