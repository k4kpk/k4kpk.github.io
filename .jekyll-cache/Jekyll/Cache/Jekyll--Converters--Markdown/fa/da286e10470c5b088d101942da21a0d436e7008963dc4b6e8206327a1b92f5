<ul>
  <li><strong>Softrock Lite 20 meters â€œMake it goâ€</strong> (after copying to /Applications).  Note: Iâ€™ve been told this is the wrong way to set it up.  Acknowledged.  This is just my record of how I got it to work the first time.
    <ul>
      <li>In Audio Devices (Window=&gt;Show/Hide Audio Devices):
        <ul>
          <li>Set the â€˜Inputâ€™ checkbox for the â€˜Built-in Inputâ€™ device.</li>
          <li>Set the â€˜Outputâ€™ checkbox for the â€˜Built-in Outputâ€™ device.</li>
          <li>Close the Audio Devices window.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>In Configuration (Window=&gt;Show/Hide Configuration):
        <ul>
          <li>Set FA SY-1 frequency to 14.0475
            <ul>
              <li>Note: The default value for Oscilator nominal frequency is 114.2335</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Press â€˜Add Configurationâ€™.
            <ul>
              <li>Set Input Gain and Output Gain to 20.
                <ul>
                  <li>Note: Once, I found it worked better with Input Gain = 70, and Output Gain = 20.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Name this Configuration SR-Lite-1</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Set the Active checkbox for SR-Lite-1
            <ul>
              <li>Note: Whenever you edit a Configuration, clear all â€˜Activeâ€™ checkboxes first!</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Close the Configuration window.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Connect an audio signal source to the Macâ€™s audio input jack. (I ran a stereo 1/8â€ patch cord from my iPhoneâ€™s earphone jack to my Mac.)</li>
      <li>Play audio on your audio source.  (I used a piano application on my iPhone.)
        <ul>
          <li>Confirm that you hear your audio on your Macâ€™s speakers, and you see the spectrum change in DSP Radio.  If you donâ€™t hear audio:
            <ul>
              <li>Plug earphones into your audio device, and make sure it is really generating audio.  (This was a problem in one of my tests.)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Replaced the audio device with the input from your Softrock Lite.
        <ul>
          <li>You should see radio signals.  If not:
            <ul>
              <li>Your antenna might be borked.  If you have another 20m radio, see if there are any signals on <em>it</em>, when using the same antenna.</li>
              <li>Try enabling AGC (Automatic Gain Control) on the Configuration window.  (Remember to make the configuration row NOT active while editing!)</li>
              <li>CW seems to work best.  Set the Mode listbox in the left pane to â€œCWâ€.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>One surprise from this exercise â€“ When set up this way, the values under the â€œRx Frequencyâ€ appear to have no impact on the frequency that is tuned.  When I press Command and scroll, those frequencies change, but the tuned signal does not.  (In fact, they are displaying about 3 kHz, and Iâ€™m receiving around 14 MHz.)  Dragging the green bar is the only way I can get it to tune.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Updated â€œMake it goâ€ based on instructions by Jas Strong</strong> (She has a video at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEfToeTW8rU ).  These work for the Ensemble RX II, which tunes from broadcast AM radio to about 30 Mhz.
    <ul>
      <li>Window=&gt;Launch Audio MIDI Setup, and choose Window=&gt;Show Audio Window.
        <ul>
          <li>Define a â€œSoftrockâ€ aggregate device in the left most pane, by clicking on the â€œ+â€.  Double-click on it, to rename it to â€œSoftrockâ€.</li>
          <li>In the physical device list (right pane), select Built-in Output, and Built-in Input, and if you have a USB Sound card, also select it.</li>
          <li>Do not close the Audio Devices window.  Move it out of the way.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Window=&gt;Show Audio Devices
        <ul>
          <li>Press Update Audio Device List, and resize the window so you can see all your devices.</li>
          <li>Select the Softrock device for Input and Output.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Window=&gt;Show Configuration
        <ul>
          <li>Press Add Configuration.  Do NOT select the Active checkbox for New Configuration!</li>
          <li>Find your Audio Devices (Audio MIDI Setup) window. Locate the â€œInâ€ and the â€œOutâ€ column in this window.
            <ul>
              <li>Where you see a zero, you donâ€™t have a device.  Where you see a 2, you have two devices.</li>
              <li>The devices are numbered from the top, starting with zero.  The input devices are counted separately from the output devices.
                <ul>
                  <li>i.e. Youâ€™ll have input devices zero and one, and output devices zero and one, and if you have more than one input/output, youâ€™ll have higher numbers too.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>In the Configuration window, set Input I and Input Q to the input devices you want to use.  If you set them both to zero and one, youâ€™ll use the first input device and the first output device listed in the Audio Devices window.</li>
          <li>Scroll a little to the right, and set input gain and output gain to 20</li>
          <li>Now you can set the Active checkbox for your new configuration.  As soon as you do, you should start hearing hissing, if your Softrock is connected.</li>
          <li>Close the Audio Devices window and the Configuration window.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
