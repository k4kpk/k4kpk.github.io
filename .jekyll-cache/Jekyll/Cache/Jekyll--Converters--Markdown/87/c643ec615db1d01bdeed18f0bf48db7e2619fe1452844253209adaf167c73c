I"œ<p>A â€œlinearâ€ system must exhibit both homogeneity and superposition.  Linear systems are interesting because they are easier to analyze than non-linear systems.</p>

<p>Superposition holds true if: \( f(x_1+x_2)=f(x_1) + f(x_2) \)</p>

<p>Homogeneity holds true if: \( f(K<em>x)=K</em>f(x) \)</p>

<p>Ohmâ€™s law is normally written as v = iR.  But you could also write it where voltage is a function of current.  e.g. f(i) = iR.</p>

<p>\( f(i_1+i+2) = f(i_1) + f(i_2) \)</p>

<p>Superposition applies to Ohmâ€™s law.  It doesnâ€™t matter whether you add currents and then compute voltage, or compute both voltages and add them.</p>

<p>Also, doubling current doubles voltage (2 is your constant), so homogeneity applies too.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Zero-out all independent sources (i.e. short your voltage sources and open your current sources).</li>
  <li>Return each source, one at a time, and solve for values of interest.</li>
  <li>Sum the values of your results.</li>
</ul>
