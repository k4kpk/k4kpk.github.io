I"³<p>Wire at AWG gauge 50 is 1 mil in diameter.  Thatâ€™s very tiny at 1/1000th of an inch.  Every 6 gauges, the wire size doubles.  i.e.</p>

<ul>
  <li>50 gauge = 1 mil</li>
  <li>44 gauge = 2 mil</li>
  <li>38 gauge = 4 mil</li>
  <li>32 gauge = 8 mil</li>
</ul>

<p>I donâ€™t think that knowing the absolute sizes is terribly useful, except as a parlor trick.  However, the next time youâ€™re looking at some 14 gauge wire and thinking, â€œI need something about half that thick,â€ you know you can get it with 20 gauge.</p>

<p>At DC, electricity flows through the wire across its entire diameter.  At high frequencies, electricity travels only on the outside of the wire â€“ as if it were a hollow tube.  At medium frequencies, some of the thickness of the wire is used.  This is called skin effect.</p>

<p>For copper wire, at 60 Hz, the â€œskinâ€ is about 1/3â€.  Consequently, unless you have VERY thick wire in your house, the entire diameter of the wire is used to conduct your house current.  At 1 MHz, the skin is less than 0.003â€.</p>

<p>The end of the skin isnâ€™t a sudden thing.  About 2/3 of the current flows in the skin.  As you move farther from the edge of the wire, less and less current flows.</p>

<p>At the moment (2015.08.17), Iâ€™m carrying about 32â€™ of poly-stealth 26 AWG, 19 strand, copper clad steel with a PE jacket as my counterpoise.  I did read that I should seal both ends to ensure the steel doesnâ€™t corrode.</p>
