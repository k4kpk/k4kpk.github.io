I"³<p>My name is Kevin Kleinfelter.  Iâ€™m an amateur radio operator in the United States.  I received my General Class license in 2012 and my Extra in 2015.</p>

<p>My radio chief interest is in <a href="http://sota.org.uk">SOTA</a>.  In short, I hike to the tops of mountains, set up a portable radio station, and make contact with other amateur radio operators around the world.</p>

<p>When one makes contact from a mountain, this is known as â€˜activatingâ€™ the summit, and the people who do this are â€˜activators.â€™  There are people who enjoy making contact with activators, and theyâ€™re known as â€˜chasers.â€™  Activators and chasers do this in order to acquire points.  The points have no value, theyâ€™re just a way to keep score.  (Nobody cares about your score but you.)</p>

<p>If we have spoken via radio and I have asked you to â€œspot me,â€ it would be a big help to me if you would do so.  When an activator is â€˜spotted,â€™ it means that someone has posted the frequency where he is operating to a web site.  Chasers watch this web site.  Once I am spotted, a bunch of them will try to contact me.  If I make 4 contacts, Iâ€™ll get my points.  Otherwise, Iâ€™ll have to climb this hill another day and try again.  To spot me, youâ€™ll have to</p>

<ul>
  <li>Go to <a href="http://sotawatch.org">http://sotawatch.org/</a> and register for an ID/password via the â€˜registerâ€™ link. (It isnâ€™t hard, and they wonâ€™t spam you â€“ at least they havenâ€™t spammed me.)<br />
    * Then you click on the â€œnew spotâ€ link and enter:
    <ul>
      <li>My call sign â€“ K4KPK</li>
      <li>My summit reference â€“ that funky list of letters and digits I gave you which identify my hill</li>
      <li>The radio frequency I am operating on</li>
      <li>The mode Iâ€™m operating on.  (e.g. SSB, AM, CW, etc.)
    * Then click the â€œAdd Spotâ€ button</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I operate mostly in Georgia.  Georgia has 14 summits which are 10-point summits (the highest number of points available for a summit).  When a summit is activated for the first time, this is (cleverly) called a â€˜first activation.â€™  I first-activated 7 of Georgiaâ€™s 14 summits.  Other people got to the remaining 10-pointers before I did.  I went on to activate the remaining seven 10-point summits in early 2013.  I was the first activator collect the full set of all 14 of Georgiaâ€™s 10-point summits.  In December of 2013, I completed my 50th activation.  In September of 2014, I activated for the 100th time.</p>

<p>My favorite summit was Stratton Bald.  My then-12-year-old son and I activated Stratton Bald on an overnight camping trip.  This was my first summit.  It was also my first QSO.  I had planned this trip months in advance.  Shortly before the trip, I received notice that the manufacturer would ship my radio to arrive a few days before our trip.  I wasnâ€™t going to cancel the trip, but I still wanted to play with my new toy.  Then I read about SOTA.  My son thought that the idea of first-activating Stratton Bald sounded pretty cool, so thatâ€™s what we did.  We lucked out and I spoke with people in Germany, England and Canada, and I had a summit-to-summit contact with someone in Canada!</p>
