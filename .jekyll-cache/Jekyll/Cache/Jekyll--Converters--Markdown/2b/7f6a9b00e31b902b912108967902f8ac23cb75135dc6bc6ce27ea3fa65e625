<p>Commentary:</p>

<p>Hightower Bald (HTB) is activated and I’ll be stiff for a few days.  ;-)</p>

<p>The weather was beautiful – High of about 60, a mild breeze, and not a cloud in the sky.  I had hoped to make a joint activation of HTB with KI4SVM but he had to cancel.</p>

<p>The first part of the trek is hiking up a dirt road.  I’ve been contemblating 4WD Forester or a CRV for driving to SOTA trails.  I’m reevaluating, in light of this “road.”  It has erosion gullies that are nearly knee deep, and I’d want a 4WD with big tires to drive it.  Since I drive a compact car, I hiked this part.</p>

<p>Part 2 is the Appalachian Trail – always easy to follow.  I am grateful to the volunteers who maintain it.</p>

<p>Part 3 was bushwhack.  I left the AT near an unnamed gap just south of Bly Gap, which I christened “Gap Obvious” (because it is).  Up Rich Knob, down to Hightower Gap; up unnamed hill, down to unnamed gap; up the ridge to HTB.  A faint trail on parts of the ridge speeds this part of the trek.  That’s good because I wasted a lot of time trying to skirt the summit of Rich Knob, and trying to regain the ridge line when I tried to skirt the dense brush on the final ascent of HTB.</p>

<p>Propagation was good.  HTB has an unusually sharp peak for a Georgia summit, which helped.  I made 21 contacts.  I’m logging only 20, because I never did figure out an unusual phonetic substitution used by one contact (N8?Y).  There may have been other chasers.  I heard some faint calls right at my noise floor.  If you called and I didn’t get you, I apologize for my ineptness.  With more practice, I’ll either get better at operating weak signals.</p>

<p>I used a carbon fiber mast, partially extended to about 18’.  My antenna was an end-fed 33’ wire in an inverted V.  I used an EARCHI 20m matchbox.  I used a 30’ counterpoise at about 4’ AGL.  This should be unnecessary for 20m; I find that it helps with SWR for 40m.  I <em>should</em> run 20m without it, and then remove the matchbox and connect the counterpoise and the antenna directly to my KX3.  That would be a more ‘normal’ setup.  I didn’t do that because I wanted to switch bands quickly.  I don’t want my 40m activators to wander off to do something else while I mess with my antenna.  (I use LMR-200 feed line, to minimize SWR-related loss between the transformer and my rig’s ATU.)</p>

<p>When I left the summit, my GPS briefly wigged out, and I made an unplanned side trip to Montgomery Corner (34.9867, -83.6199).  I’m sure there’s an interesting story about why the state line makes this funny corner and I know that some people visit it intentionally.  (It was an unremarkable sight, IMHO.)</p>

<p>I’m glad I got the GPS straightened out before going too far into North Carolina.  From the GPS trace of my route, there’s an obvious point where I made a gradual turn 90 degrees left.  I kept thinking that my shadow wasn’t where it should be.  (When bushwhacking, I mostly navigate with reference to my shadow.  e.g. ‘Follow my shadow’ or ‘keep my shadow off my right shoulder.’)</p>

<p>If my GPS is dead, I can use the GPS in my iPhone as backup, or use a topo and compass if I go for a swim and ruin my electronics, but I have to <em>know</em> my GPS is borked in order to make the switch.  In this case, the GPS somehow tied its you-are-here to its cursor, so wherever I put the cursor, it said I was going straight that way.  It wasn’t until I knew I had NOT been traveling in a perfectly straight line that I figured out the problem.</p>

<p>In planning the trip, I’d said that this it was at my absolute limit for a one day activation.  That was accurate.  I’d have been in trouble if I had to do another half mile.  My last mile out was <em>much</em> slower than my first mile in.  The total distance was OK, but bushwhacking straight up Rich Knob is a killer.</p>

<p>It was a good trip and I feel like I accomplished something.  I’m sorta sorry to see the last of the un-activated Georgia 10-pointers get activated.  Trying to get to them before someone else did has really motivated me to get off my duff and on the trail.</p>

<p>Thank you chasers!</p>
