####Trail Guide from Cloudland (short route)

* **Duration**: 0.8 miles, 250' climb, 0:20
* **Note**: Flush toilets and a water fountain at trailhead.
* **Navigation**
    * If you follow the trail at the restroom end of the parking lot, you'll come to the AT, where you turn R.  There is a surprising amount of descent before the trail turns up.  This descent is heavily eroded.
        * To avoid the eroded part, you can walk back down the paved road.  After a few hundred yards, you'll pass a gated road on your R.  There will be some big rock on your L and a faint trail.  This trail runs about 100' to the AT, where you can turn R.  I took this route (in reverse, when I hiked out on 9/27/2014.)
    * At restroom end of parking lot, take connector trail to AT.
    * R on AT.
    * After you've been climbing for a while, when you're beside the summit (or just a little past), the trail will turn slightly down.  This is where you'll find the blue blazed trail to the shelter and the summit.
