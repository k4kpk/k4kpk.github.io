SOTA (Summits On The Air) is an awards program to encourage operating from the tops of mountains.  "Activators" get points for operating from a summit.  "Chasers" get points for contacting activators.  Points are good for... counting, and not much else!

__Why would I want to activate?__ 

My XYL, certifiably smarter than me, says, "It is a perfect combination.  You get to spend time outdoors *and* you get to collect shiny toys."  That pretty well sums it up.

Have you ever hiked to the top of a mountain and wondered, "This is nice view.  What do I do now?"  Now you have a *mission*.  Pull out the radio, throw a wire into a tree, and work a pile-up.  When you call CQ from a summit, it seems as if *everyone* wants to talk with you.

There are a variety of awards, including the Mountain Goat award for 1000 points, Activators who achieve 1,000 points earn the Mountain Goat award.  As of mid-December 2014, only 21 hams in the US have achieved this award.

Other reasons to activate:

* Tired of QRM?  The nearest source of QRM is typically miles away.
* HOA restricts your antenna height? *My* tower is on a 4,000 foot base.
* Operating VHF? Line of sight can be 100 miles in all directions.

__Why would I want to chase?__

It's easy enough to work Bubba, with his QRO kilowatt and a beam pointed at you.  Hone your skills pulling a 2 watt signal sent from a random wire in a tree out of thunderstorm QRN. (" I know he's there.  I can hear others working him. Maybe if I narrow my filter and up the RF gain...  Bingo!  Got him.")

Make progress on your Worked All States award.  Anywhere there's a qualified summit, sooner or later, you'll find an activator.  Earn the prestigious Shack Sloth trophy.  (SOTA has a sense of humor!)

With a good antenna, go after DX activators.  Make contact with a ham who's clipped to a piton from a summit in the Alps.  See if you can QSO with that operator who's perched on the rim of a volcano.  (Yes, this happens.)

__Activating or chasing isn't enough of a challenge.  What else have you got?__

Maybe you'd like to combine chasing *and* activating.  When two activators make contact, this is a "summit-to-summit."  Since you're both QRP and you're both mountain-top portable, this is even more of a challenge (and more gratifying when you succeed).

__SOTA isn't fair!__

It is important to note that SOTA is not about *fairness* -- it is about *participation*.  There are easy 10-point summits and there are epic 1-pointers.  Do not look for fairness in SOTA scoring.  It isn't there.  

The rules of SOTA are designed to encourage participation -- to get activators activating and chasers chasing.  From time to time, someone will propose a modification of the rules, to rationalize scoring.  Socially, this is on par with passing gas at a dinner party!

__But I'm not athletic and I don't have a quad at 60 feet. Can I play too?__

Activation requires operating portably from a qualified SOTA summit.  At a minimum, you've got to carry your equipment away from your vehicle, and you must use a battery or solar power.  *Most* activations require a hike up the side of a mountain, but remember that the goal of SOTA is participation.  At one extreme, you could drive to a drive-up summit, climb into a wheelchair, have a buddy pile your equipment into your lap, push you across the parking lot, and you could operate from a picnic table.  At the other extreme, you could backpack 2 days into wilderness, followed by a 5 mile bushwhack, and operate from a snow-covered escarpment.
