#### Trail Guide

* **Duration**: 0:50
* **Navigation**
    * Cartersville publishes a brochure about the area at http://www.cityofcartersville.org/DocumentCenter/Home/View/570 . Print it, and carry the map.
    * Note: The trail is clearly but obscurely marked! There are posts with arrows at each intersection. However, some posts have only colored arrows. The color matches the color on the map. If you print the map in black-and-white, you've got a problem applying the color code.
    * If you didn't bring a color-printed map, just take the right-most trail at each intersection, going up from the west parking lot.

* **GPS tracks/waypoints**:
    * Pine Mountain west parking lot = 34.17534, -84.75366
