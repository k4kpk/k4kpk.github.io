If you are a SOTA Chaser, you might be familiar with [SOTA Goat](http://ww1x.com/sotagoat/).  One thing which SOTA Goat does nicely is to alert you when someone has been spotted.

If you want a similar notification on your Windows PC, try [KU6J's SOTA Spot Monitor](http://www.ku6j.com).  It will notify you whenever a SOTA activator gets spotted.
