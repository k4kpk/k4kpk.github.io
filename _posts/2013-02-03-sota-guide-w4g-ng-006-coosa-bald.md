####Trail Guide

* **Duration**: 0:30 and an 0.7 mile hike.
* **Navigation**
    * The trailhead has easy parking for two cars.
        * It is 1.25 miles from GA-180, and it is pretty obvious.
        * The trailhead is marked by a brown post with a green blaze.
    * Once you're parked, if you look back up the road, you'll see where the trail from GA-180 comes in.
    * On the trail, you'll see blue blazes and green blazes. Follow the blue blazes when the green blazes turn right (trail junction).
        * Duncan Ridge Trail goes straight, leading to Coosa Bald. Blue blazes.
        * Green blazed Coosa trail goes right (when hiking TO summit) and does NOT lead to Coosa Bald.
        * There is a double green blaze on a tree to the left of this junction.
        * On December 28, 2012, there was a trail sign, clearly labeling the trails.

####Summit Guide

* Hang antenna from tree: No problems.
* Space to guy mast: Not a lot of space.  Could bungee a mast to a stump.
* Antenna notes:
    * Trees around the opening at the summit. Not a lot of real tall trees. Mostly semi-dwarf. Space to guy out a vertical is limited right at the summit, but there's space among the trees within the activation zone.

* Cell coverage: 
    * No cell coverage is available at the summit. However, I got 4 bars on the trail about 1/4 mile short of the summit. If you want to self-spot, take a collaborator with you and send him/her back up the trail when you're ready to go on the air.
    * I briefly had VZN coverage, and got out a test email, but could not post a spot.
    * KI4SVM reported no cell coverage on 2013.01.19
    * 2013.12.15 - My APRS self-spot went out promptly.
* Unique features:
    * There is a view in the winter.
