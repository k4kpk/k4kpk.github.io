SOTA stands for Summits On The Air.  SOTA is all about making ham radio contacts from mountain tops.

There are three kinds of people in SOTA:

* Activators - Activators hike/climb to the tops of mountains and make contacts.  This is called an "activation."
* Chasers - Chasers listen for activators and respond when the activator calls CQ
* People who haven't heard of SOTA ;-)

I'm principally a SOTA activator.  When people ask me what I'm doing, I tell them, "I hike to the tops of mountains, set up an amateur radio station, and I talk to people from around the world."  If I tell this to young people, they generally respond, "That's cool!"  OTOH, if I tell them I'm a ham radio operator, I can see them thinking, "Boring old man stuff."

SOTA is an "awards program" and not a contest.  In other words, it is sort of like collecting merit badges as a Boy Scout.  You don't "win" SOTA and you don't defeat someone in SOTA.  You make achievements in SOTA and you can get certificates recognizing these achievements.  Activators get points for activating summits by making contacts from the summits.  Chasers get points for making contacts with activators (when they are on a summit).

The only thing you can do with your points is to count them.  There's no prize.  There's no winner.  You just count your points.  If you collect enough points, you can buy a certificate which says you got that many points.

Why bother?  As John Kennedy said, "We choose to go to the moon, not because it is easy but because it is hard."  It is an achievement to climb to the top of a mountain, set up your equipment, and to talk with someone on another continent on the amount of power it takes to light up a night light.  If you're a chaser, it is an achievement to 'catch' an activator for the few minutes he's transmitting from a summit.

From summits in the southeastern United States, I've talked with hams in England, Scotland, Finland, Germany, Spain, Portugal, The Canary Islands, Canada, and the United States.  When I hear from someone in Finland, I feel like I've accomplished something difficult.  For that ham in Finland who managed to pick out my weak signal from thousands of miles away in the 15 minutes I was there, fitting in around the 20 other stations also trying to contact me, he accomplished something difficult.
