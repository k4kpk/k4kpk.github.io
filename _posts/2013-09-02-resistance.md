"Resistance is useless." -- Daleks; Doctor Who

Resistors in series:
\\( R_{1} + R_{2} + R_{3} \\)

Resistors in parallel:
\\( \left ( \frac{1}{R_{1}} + \frac{1}{R_{2}} + \frac{1}{R_{3}} \right )^{-1} \\)

Voltage divider (using resistors in series):
\\( v_1=\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2}v \\)

![Voltage divider](http://k4kpk.com/sites/k4kpk.com/files/ebook/Voltage-Divider.png)

* \\( v_1 \\) = The voltage across the first resistor
* v = The voltage across both resistors

Current divider (using resistors in parallel):
\\( i_1=\frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2}i \\)

* \\( i_1 \\) = The current through the first resistor.

At RF, all resistors act like a resistor, an inductor, and a capacitor.  For the three major types of resistors:

* Carbon composition resistors - act a lot like a capacitor, due to the capacitance between the granules.
* Wirewound resistors - act a lot like an inductor, because the wire looks a lot like a coil.
* Metal film resistors - act closer to an ideal resistor (but not perfectly so) than the other types.  "Thin film" surface mount are the best of the best.
