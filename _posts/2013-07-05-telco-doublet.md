Many of you have heard of the [Norcal Doublet](http://www.norcalqrp.org/norcaldoublet.htm), which uses 4-conductor ribbon cable.  I couldn't find a *cheap* source for 50' of ribbon cable, but Home Depot sells 50' flat telephone extension cords for less than $8.  It too has 4 conductors.  I thought it might be interesting to see how it might work as an alternative to the Norcal Doublet.

First "learning:" A CETech (Home Depot House Brand) 50' telephone cord actually measures 47' 3.5".  I guess that's 50' like a nominal 2x4 is 1.5" x 3.5".  So instead of having 22' dipole legs and a 28' feed line, I'm going to have 22' dipole legs and an approximately 25' feed line.
