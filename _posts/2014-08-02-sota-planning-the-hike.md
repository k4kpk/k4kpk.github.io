Here are some notes on planning my route.  

* As of July/August 2014, I'm rebuilding my laptop files/programs after some hardware problems, so I'm re-thinking what I store on my computer.
    * I am not going to install Delorme Topo 10.
        * It occupies 10GB. It does have some content my other maps don't have, but much of the additional content is for trails that don't really exist.  It requires Windows.
    * For topo quadrangles -  [CalTopo](http://caltopo.com/map.html#ll=35.08725,-83.65303&z=6&b=t)
        * I used to download topo quadrangles from the [USGS Map Store](http://store.usgs.gov/b2c_usgs/usgs/maplocator/(xcm=r3standardpitrex_prd&layout=6_1_61_48&uiarea=2&ctype=areaDetails&carea=$ROOT)/.do).  I'm switching to online use of CalTopo.  I might occasionally download a topo - perhaps a historical edition of a map to see roads that aren't shown on current maps.  If CalTopo goes offline, I can go back to downloading USGS quads.  For now, I'll avoid having the local data.  The down-side is that I can't plan my trips when offline, but that is an infrequent need.
* Handheld GPS - Garmin Etrex 30.
    * Garmin has bigger units. Small is better for extended hikes. This one runs all day on a pair of rechargeable AA.
    * Used with Garmin Basecamp software.
    * Used with Garmin Topo US 100K
        * I could go with the Southeast 24K series for more detail.  I couldn't fit everything on the GPS unit.  It might be nice to have higher map detail, but the GPS positioning isn't *that* accurate.
* Convert Google Maps route (URL) to GPX - [GPS Visualizer - Convert Input](http://www.gpsvisualizer.com/convert_input)

* GPS/GPX to Google Maps - [GPS Visualizer - Make a Map](http://www.gpsvisualizer.com/map_input) or [VeloRoutes](http://veloroutes.org/upload/)
* Convert GPS data file formats (e.g. KML to GPX) - [GPS Babel](http://www.gpsbabel.org/capabilities.html)
* Reduce the detail (fewer points) in a GPX file - [GPS Babel](http://www.gpsbabel.org/capabilities.html)
* I haven't tried this, but it looks interesting for finding out who owns private land around a summit: http://www.huntinggpsmaps.com/store/hunt-mobile-apps
