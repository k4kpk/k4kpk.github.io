Commentary:

I drove to the trailhead, but did not hike to the summit.  This summit is on Cherokee land.  The Mile High Campground, near the trailhead, is run by a Cherokee.  I had planned to ask him for permission, but the campground closed for winter on October 15.

There is a gate across the trail.  In my book, crossing a gate on private land is trespassing, so I did not cross the gate.
