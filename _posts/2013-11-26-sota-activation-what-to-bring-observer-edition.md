*I'm going to tag along on a SOTA activation as an observer.  What do I need to bring?*

Just bring the usual items you'd take for a hike in the mountains, plus something to sit on.

* Water (to drink)
* Snack, if desired
* Sunscreen, bug dope, etc., if you need that sort of thing when you're outdoors
* Clothing suitable for the season.  You'll work up a sweat getting to the summit.  Then you'll sit around for an hour or more.  Summits are often windy.  Bring a little more clothing than you think you'll need.
* Bring something to sit on.  You can bring a foam pad, or a small ground cloth, etc.  You're going to sit on top of that mountain for an hour or more.  Some summits are rocky.  Some are covered with moist dirt.  Some are covered with poison ivy.
* Hiking staff, trekking poles, etc., if you use that sort of thing.  Remember that you'll be hiking up a mountain and then back down.  (Hiking down hurts my knees.)
