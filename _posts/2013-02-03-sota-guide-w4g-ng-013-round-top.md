Trip-specific: Drive to Trailhead & Trail Guide
--------------------------------------------------------
##### Combined Double Spring Knob and Round Top Activation

#### Drive Guide

* **Duration**: 2:30 from Atlanta
* **Google Maps** URL from I-285 at 33.91819, -84.33747: http://goo.gl/maps/QQRl2
* **Seasonal/Limited Access**:
* **Directions**:
    * CAREFUL: The default Google Maps route got the penultimate bits WRONG!  
        * My URL above avoids the wrong bit.  
        * Do NOT turn left on Verner Kastner.  It is a private driveway.
        * Continue 0.3 miles past Verner Kastner and turn left on West Wildcat Rd.
    * About 2:30 from Atlanta.
    * From I-285, take I-85 north.
    * Take I-985 north, when you come to it. Stay on it when it turns to GA-365.
    * Travel 45.1 miles total on 985/365.
    * At Cornelia, take US-441 Historical north (left). Go 0.7.
    * Left on GA-105. Go 8.5.
    * Left on GA-17. Go 3.5.
    * Right on Ben T Hulet Hwy. Go 3.3.
    * Right on GA-255 north. Go 3.1.
    * Left on GA-197. Go 7.1.
    * Left on West Wildcat Rd.  Set your trip odometer to zero here and don't touch it until you park.
        * W. Wildcat Road is on your left, just after the volunteer fire station. 
        * There's a street sign with the road name, a forest service sign for the area, and a forest service sign with mileages to campgrounds.
        * Your left turn onto Wildcat is at N34.83075 W83.58478.
        * The dirt road was drivable in my 2006 Toyota Corolla. There were a few spots in the road where any additional erosion will create a problem.
        * There's a gate at 0.9 miles. It was open on December 30.
        * There's a gate at 7.7, one mile short of Addis Gap. It was closed and it is always closed. There's parking for 3-4 cars within sight of the gate.

* **Food**
    * Last McDonalds: 
        * It comes just BEFORE Cornelia and your exit to US-441.
        * Google Maps says there is a McDonalds to the right on US-441. It isn't there. I looked hard.
        * It is actually 1 or two exits before Cornelia on Level Grove Rd or Duncan Bridge Rd.
    * Penultimate McDonalds: 
        * 3183 Frontage Rd, Gainesville.  GA-53 / Mundy Mill Rd exit.
    * Dinner
* **On the way home** (scouting/errands):
    * Don't plan any.  This is a long hike.  You'll be tired.

####Trail Guide

* **Duration**: TOTAL = 4:20
    * 1:20 from parking to Double Spring Knob (if don't scout alternate bushwhacks)
    * 0:50 from Double Spring Knob back to Addis Gap
    * 0:10 rest stop in Addis Gap
    * 1:00 from Addis Gap to Round Top
    * 1:00 from Round Top back to parking
* Significant bushwhacking - I couldn't have made it to the summits without my GPS.
* **Navigation (parking to Double Spring)**:
    * There's a gate on Wildcat Road, about a mile from the AT. You may find references to a another gate. I found its remains, about half way between the 1-mile gate and Addis Gap.
Walk past the gate and up the road.
    * When you come to a T, take the trail to your left. It is marked with a forest service iron post with a diamond on it.
    * When you come to Addis Gap, it is well marked. It is also clearly a gap, with the dirt road you enter on cresting and continuing forward and down. The AT extends to your left and your right. You turn right for the summit.
    * The AT is easy to follow.
    * When you're near the summit, the trail crosses over the ridge and starts to descend. You don't descend. It is about 1:20 from where you parked to this point, hiking at a moderate pace.
    * Bushwhack from the trail to the summit. Good luck. It took me 40 minutes in the snow and ice. Probably much easier with better conditions.
* **Navigation (Double Spring to Round Top)**:
    * Backtrack to Addis Gap.
    * Continue through Addis Gap. The AT is easy to follow.
    * When you're near the summit, the trail curves around the end of the ridge. It is about 45 minutes from Addis Gap, hiking at a moderate pace. 
    * Bushwhack from the trail to the summit. This was easier than my bushwhack on Double Spring Knob in the morning. This one took me 25 minutes in the snow and ice. Will be easier with better conditions.
    
* **GPS tracks/waypoints**:
    * Trailhead at the gate = 34.86298, -83.64907
    * Trail/road junction. Turn LEFT = 34.86698, -83.65280
    * Addis Gap and the Appalachian Trail = 34.86317, -83.65616
        * Turn right for Double Spring Knob; turn left for Round Top
    * High point on the AT. Begin Double Spring bushwhack = 34.87587, -83.65467
        * Note: I returned to the AT at 34.87749, -83.65464. There was less brush via this route. Consider beginning your bushwhack here, but expect a steep climb.
    * Double Spring summit - I operated from 34.87812, -83.65638, which was well inside the activation zone, but not at exact apex. Official summit is 34.878502, -83.656898.
    * Round Top bushwhack begins = 34.84812, -83.66028
        * Note: I returned to the AT at 34.84834, -83.66022. This would be an OK point to depart the AT.
    * On the ground, the summit looked to be 34.84812, -83.66182. Official summit is at 34.848202, -83.661697, but that's not what it looks like on the ground.


####Summit Guide: Double Spring Knob

* Hang antenna from tree: I struggled with this. (I was last there in the snow.)  Dense, scrubby trees made it tough.  I threw a wire in a tree and zigzagged it through bushes.
* Space to guy mast: I recommend carrying a mast and using bungee cords or velcro to bind it to a tree stump.
* Cell coverage:
    * I got 2-3 bars on my iPhone. I tried to self-spot, and the phone said the SMS went out, but it looks like maybe I turned the phone off too quickly. It didn't get delivered until much later in the day.
    * Back at Addis Gap, I tried email, but GMail insisted in working in offline mode.
    * You SHOULD be able to get off an SMS to self-spot.
* Unique features:
    * Briars.  No view.

####Summit Guide: Round Top

* Hang antenna from tree: Yes.  No problem.
* Space to guy mast: Yes.  No problem.
* Cell coverage: Good cell coverage. SMS self-spot went out promptly.
* Unique features:
    * No view.

####Plan-B Candidates

* You should have a Plan-B for this one.  There are some spots in the road that will wash out if not maintained soon, and if you go in the winter, be sure to check on the status of those gates.
* Little Bald Knob?
* Tray Mountain?
* The OTHER Round Top (W4G/NG-030)?
* Spaniard Mountain?
