Big ham contests can interfere with the SOTA activation experience. There's a contest somewhere, just about every weekend, so the best you can do is to avoid the really BIG ones.  If you must activate on a contest weekend, CW and SSB all run on different weekends - use the mode not in play for the contest that weekend or head to the WARC bands.

When you set a date for your activation:

* Check the [ARRL contest calendar](http://www.arrl.org/contest-calendar). (Check "Contest Corral" at the bottom of the page to get non-ARRL contests)
* OR check [http://www.hornucopia.com/contestcal/perpetualcal.php](http://www.hornucopia.com/contestcal/perpetualcal.php)
* The big weekends to avoid are:
    * Phone (SSB and other modes)
        * March
            * 1st full weekend in March (All Sat+Sun UTC) - ARRL DX (Phone)
            * Last weekend in March (All Sat+Sun UTC) - CQ WPX (Phone).  Very big. I found no clear frequencies on 17/20/40 in 2015 at 5 PM.
