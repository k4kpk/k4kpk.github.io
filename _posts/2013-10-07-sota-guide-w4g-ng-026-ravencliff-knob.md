Trip-specific: Drive to Trailhead & Trail Guide
--------------------------------------------------------
#### Drive Guide - Ravencliff Knob (W4G/NG-026) from Standing Indian (W4C/WM-014)

* **Duration**: 1:15 
* **Google Maps** URL from Ashford Dunwoody Rd and I-285 at 33.91998, -84.33898: 
* **Seasonal/Limited Access**: 
    * There are some gates.  They were open.  This is either a county road or owned by the FAA, and there is no published schedule.  The gates could be closed (for good) at any time.
    * Ivy Log Gap Rd and Ravencliff FAA Rd are both somewhat rough. Ravencliff FAA Rd is *very* seldom travelled and the weeds in between the twin-tracks will scrape the bottom of your car and make a noise that makes you think something is dragging the ground.
* **Directions** (from Standing Indian trailhead):
    * Head back the way you came in. (As you come *down* the trail from Standing Indian, you want to turn right on the *far* side of the hairpin.  Don't go on the downhill road.) Go 5.7.
    * L on US-64 W and go 18.4
    * Note: Somewhere on US-64 I picked up a cell signal, and Google Maps app (on the iPad) navigated me to 34.93995, -83.92687 with no problem.

    * L on Byers Creek Rd and go 1.8
    * L on Ivy Log Gap Rd and go 2 miles or so.  Turns to dirt.  Somewhat longer drive that offline Google Maps thinks.
    * Sharp R on Ravencliff FAA Rd and go 1.4 to fork in road.
    * R fork at N34.93983 W83.92659
    * And park at gate at N34.93995 W83.92687
