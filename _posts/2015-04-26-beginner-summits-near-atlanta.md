**I’d like to try a SOTA activation; can I start with an easy hill?**
 
This month’s column will cover some north Georgia summits which are particularly
suitable for tyro activators or for an experienced activator who is looking for
a relatively easy activation.

I make it a point to identify summits with restrooms; this is important if you
take your family along for the activation.  (One ham’s XYL sheltered in a privy
while he activated in sub-zero weather!)

* [W4G/HC-003, Stone Mountain](/content/sota-guide-w4ghc-003-stone-mountain)

    Stone Mountain is near Atlanta.  If you don’t want to walk up, you can ride
    the tram to the top. Due to terrain, it is a great location for a magnetic
    loop or other tripod-based antenna.  There *is* a tree in the activation
    zone, if you want to throw a wire into it, and you can always bungee a mast
    to a fence.

    This is a very reachable trailhead.  There are paved roads all the way to
    the trailhead.  You can get there via MARTA or Uber, if you’re determined.

    There are lots of tourists on top, but with some care, you can pick a spot
    that is not too busy.  If you can, take a partner.  He/she can answer
    questions from gawkers while you’re on the air.  Remember that you are an
    ambassador for SOTA, and that you will provide the first impression of SOTA
    to many onlookers.

    There are restrooms on the summit.

    Technicians: You should have plenty of VHF activity, given the proximity to
    Atlanta. Remember that you cannot make contacts via repeater for SOTA, but
    you can call up the repeater and ask hams to meet you on simplex for SOTA
    credit.

 
* [W4G/HC-005, Springer Mountain](/content/sota-guide-w4ghc-005-springer-mountain)

    Springer Mountain is famous for being the start of the Appalachian Trail.
    While it would be a long walk from Amicalola Falls State Park, there is a
    “back route” to the summit which is about a mile.  Since it is on the
    Appalachian Trail, the trail is well marked.

    There is a privy in the camping area, just prior to the summit.

    The road to the “back route” trailhead is dirt and some of it is bumpy.  It
    is drivable in most weather in a passenger sedan.

    
* [W4G/HC-036 Pine Mountain](/content/sota-guide-w4ghc-036-pine-mountain)

    *This* Pine Mountain is near Atlanta, with a modest hike.  It is very close
    to I-75, so it isn’t hard to find.  The trailhead is reachable via paved
    roads; the parking lot is gravel.

    Its chief selling point is that it is convenient to Atlanta and that the
    summit isn’t overrun with tourists, like Stone Mountain.  There are trees in
    the activation zone, so that makes “wire in a tree” antennas feasible.

    Technicians: You should have plenty of VHF activity, given the proximity to
    Atlanta. Remember that you cannot make contacts via repeater for SOTA, but
    you can call up the repeater and ask hams to meet you on simplex for SOTA
    credit.


* [W4G/HC-043 Vineyard Mountain](/content/sota-guide-w4ghc-043-vineyard-mountain)

    Its chief selling point is that it is convenient to Atlanta and that the
    summit isn’t overrun with tourists, like Stone Mountain.  There are trees in
    the activation zone, so that makes “wire in a tree” antennas feasible.

    The trailhead is accessible via paved roads.  It is in a recreation area, so
    there should be restrooms somewhere nearby, but I’ve never found them.

    Technicians: You should have plenty of VHF activity, given the proximity to
    Atlanta. Remember that you cannot make contacts via repeater for SOTA, but
    you can call up the repeater and ask hams to meet you on simplex for SOTA
    credit.


* [W4G/NG-001 Brasstown Bald](/content/sota-guide-w4gng-001-brasstown-bald)

    Brasstown Bald is the highest point in Georgia.  There is a visitor center
    on top and an observation deck.  The parking lot is reachable via paved road
    and there is a shuttle van from the lot to the summit.

    There are restrooms on the summit and at the parking lot.

    You could use an HT from the observation deck, but I wouldn’t recommend
    trying HF from the deck.  *Someone* is bound to object to your antenna.
    There is a trail from the parking lot to the summit.  20 feet before this
    trail reaches the summit, there is a small, grassy lawn to the right (as you
    *ascend*).  You can guy a mast here, or throw a wire into the trees along
    the side of the lawn.

    There are lots of tourists on top.  If you can, take a partner.  He/she can
    answer questions from gawkers while you’re on the air.  Remember that you
    are an ambassador for SOTA, and that you will provide the first impression
    of SOTA to many onlookers.

    The shuttle and the center are run by a contractor (Cradle of Forestry).
    Its personnel were inquisitive when I was last there.  They wanted to be
    sure I was *amateur* and not commercial, but they weren’t a problem.  Please
    be nice to them so they’ll be nice to future hams.


* [W4G/NG-020, Wildcat Mountain](/content/sota-guide-w4gng-020-wildcat-mountain)

    Wildcat Mountain is one of the non-urban summits nearest to Atlanta.  It is
    good for 8 points, and there’s a nice view near the summit.  The trailhead
    is accessible via paved road.

    With a modest drive and a modest hike, you can activate this one and get
    back to Atlanta is a half-day outing.  The trail is easy to follow, but
    parts are steep.


* [W4G/NG-022, Black Mountain](/content/sota-guide-w4gng-022-black-mountain)

    Black Mountain is a modest drive from Dahlonega.  The ’trail’ is a gravel
    road that’s easy to follow.  There’s a fire tower on top, with a small
    grassy area that makes a good activation spot.

    Do NOT believe Google Maps about the location of the trailhead.  Google Maps
    mistakes a power line for a dirt road.  For the real trailhead, see my trail
    guide at the link for Black Mountain (above).

    There is a privy at the trailhead.

    Note that when the wind shifts, there’s a loose antenna on the tower that
    moves.  It creaks loudly.  This can be startling if you think you’re the
    only person on the summit and then you hear a loud creak.

    There’s a good barbecue place in Dahlonega, for your post-activation meal.


* [W4G/NG-027, Black Rock Mountain](/content/sota-guide-w4gng-027-black-rock-mountain)

    Black Rock Mountain (sometimes spelled Blackrock Mountain) is north of
    Clayton, Georgia.  It is Georgia’s highest state park.  The trailhead is
    accessible via paved roads.  The trail is steep, but it is less than a mile
    to the activation zone.

    You can go all the way to the summit, but Tennessee Rock, shortly before the
    summit, is in the activation zone and it has a nicer view.

    The trail can be confusing.  During peak tourist season, there is sometimes
    a park employee at the parking area, handing out trail maps.  Take one!
    Also, see my trail guide at the Black Rock Mountain link (above).

    There are restrooms near the trailhead, but they’re a bit far to walk.

See you on the summits!
