Here's a tutorial on how to use [http://sotamaps.wsstvc.org/](http://sotamaps.wsstvc.org/) to pick out a valid SOTA summit.  For this tutorial, let's imagine you live in Covington, Georgia, and you want to activate a nearby summit.

* Set the *Choose Association* field to *W4G - USA - Georgia*
* Set *Choose Region* to *W4G/CE - Central*
* Click on the "2" in the triangle to the east of Atlanta.  You just picked Stone Mountain.
* A box will pop up with info about Stone Mountain.  The title of the box is a hyperlink to more info.  Click it.
* If someone has activated the summit before, there is *probably* a link under "Resources", with tips on finding/activating the summit from someone who has done it before.
* Near the top of this page, you'll see something like "Summit Information for xxx/yy-nnn".  xxx/yy-nnn is the Summit ID. For Stone Mountain, the code is W4G/CE-003.  Write down the code for your summit because you'll need it.
