* **CAUTION**: The last 200 yards of this hike are in dense rhododendron.  I had to crawl on hands and knees, and I lost some equipment.  I will never attempt this trip again without saw, pruning shears, or other trail-clearing equipment!  Do not attempt this trip unless you can handle an extremely difficult bushwhack after a 3.8 mile hike, climbing 2400 feet.

* Please: Just take another trip.  This one isn't worth the pain.  I was still recovering a week later.
