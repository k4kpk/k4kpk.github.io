    * Note that the approach from the west is a little quicker, but the road from the east was  better maintained in 2013.
    * March 15, 2014, both the east and west routes were in good shape.
    
* **Directions (western approach)**:
    * I-285 W
    * I-75 N
    * I-575 N
    * GA-5 N.  Go 55.6 miles.
    * L on 1st Ave. 
        * (1st traffic light after Ingles/McDonalds.) 
        * Go 500 ft. Cross the bridge.
    * L on River St - a.k.a. GA-52. Go 1 mile.
    * Ellijay downtown roundabout. Stay on 52.  Go 5.0
    * R on Gates Chapel Rd.  (Cohutta Self-storage sign.)  Go 5.2.
    * Bear R on Wilderness Trail. (Google calls it Wilderness Rd. Becomes FS90) Go 1.5.
        * When you come to Pinhoti trail intersection #1, keep R to stay on FS90.
        * When you come to Pinhoti trail intersection #2, keep L to stay on FS90.
        * These were well-marked when I drove it, but sometimes signs come down...
    * Hairpin R onto FS 68 (a.k.a. Conasauga Rd), go 3.3.
    * R on Conasauga Lake Rd (FS 64) at T with sign to E. Cowpen Trail #30, and go 4.2.
        * Note: This T shows up in my directions to multiple summits, and I frequently refer to it as the "Conasauga T".  
        * For reference, it takes 30 minutes to drive from the Ellijay square to the Conasauga T.
        * For reference, it takes about 20 minutes minutes to drive from the Conasauga T to the Cowpen Mountain trailhead.
    * Park in gravel lot on sharp turn
* **Food**
    * Last McDonalds: Ellijay (East Ellijay). 
    * Penultimate McDonalds: Jasper.
    * Dinner
        * Poole's Barbecue "Pig Hill" at 164 Craig Street, Ellijay. Closes at 7/8/8/6, Thurs/        Fri/Sat/Sun.
        * Note: There's a Barbecue place in Blue Ridge that has several billboards with directions telling you to turn at Wendy's. The pulled pork there is dry and taste-free.

#### Drive Guide - Cowpen from Dyer Cemetery
* Drive south (toward 64A side road to Flat Top) on USFS-64 for 5.1 miles.  Parking is on right, just as road makes sharp left turn.  Parking is somewhat over the crest of a rise, so you can't see it until you're right next to it.

#### Trail Guide

* **Duration**: 
    * Flat route: 1:30  (1.7 miles; 635 ft climb). 0:40 descent
    * Short route: 0:50 (1.3 miles; 635 ft climb).  0:40 descent (0:25 if you run)
* **Navigation**
    * Trail is FT-30.  East Cowpen Trail, heading north.  All on the ridge.
    * At 0.4 miles, FT-12 (Rough Ridge) branches to right, and is NOT our trail.
    * From this point, the ridge crest will be to your left.
    * **Short Route**
        * At 34.89306, -84.57474, there is a draw to your left.  Follow it up to the ridge.
        * Once you reach the ridge you are in the activation zone.
        * If desired, turn left and follow the ridge to the high point.   Summit is indistinct. 
            * If you go left, foliage is less dense on the near (east) edge of the ridge.
    * **Flat Route**
        * At about 1.3 miles, sharp turn to left, heading south, is final approach to summit.
        * You have hiked PAST the summit, to a gap.  Now you bushwhack up the ridge crest to the summit.  It isn't a tough bushwhack in early March, except there are some briars to avoid.  It might be worse in the growing season.
        * Summit at 1.7 miles.  Summit is indistinct.

* **Trailhead altitude**: 3506' @ trailhead
* **Summit altitude**: 4151'
