These are summits I recommend for beginners (or just when you want a low-effort activation) in Tennessee.

* [W4T/SU-005, Roan High Knob](/content/sota-guide-w4tsu-005-roan-high-knob)
    * All paved-road drive; flush toilets at trailhead; views from trailhead.
* [W4T/WM-047, Toxaway Mountain](/content/sota-guide-w4twm-047-toxaway-mountain)
    * All paved-road drive; drive-up summit.
