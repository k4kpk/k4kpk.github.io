Update: KU6J, author of RBNGate passed away.  I do not know the current status of RBNGate.  It may not be functional any longer.

RBNGate is wonderful, if you are a CW activator.  All you have to do to get spotted is to post an alert at [http://sotawatch.org/alerts.php](http://sotawatch.org/alerts.php), and then go on the air within a couple of hours of your alerted time.  RBN will do its magic and spot you as a CW QSO.  RBNGate will notice that RBN spotted you and it will check SOTAwatch and see that you're alerted for a summit.  It will assume that you're on the summit you said you'd activate, and it will post a spot to [http://sotawatch.org/spots.php](http://sotawatch.org/spots.php).

Once you're spotted on SOTAwatch, you'll get a pile-up.

Here are instructions(modified slightly) from the NASota mailing list regarding how to get spotted via RBNGate:

    You will be tracked beginning one hour before your alert's ETA and ending 3 hours after it (4 hours total). If you ever want to change that period, you can enter a comment that includes something like S-2 S+5. That would cause you to be tracked beginning 2 hours before your ETA until 5 hours after it. 
    
    The key to getting spotted by RBN is to:
    
    1) Send "CQ" at least twice. If there is a "SOTA" in there after the second one, that's OK too.
    2) Follow those by "DE"
    3) Follow "DE" by your callsign at least once, twice is better.
    4) Send with a good fist, *at a constant speed*. That last part is important.
    
    To make sure you get #4 right, program the following into my your auto-keyer:
    
    CQ CQ SOTA DE K4KPK K4KPK K
    
    Send that as the first CQ, get auto-spotted, keep sending it until the first chaser arrives (usually within 60 seconds), then later shorten it up to CQ SOTA DE K4KPK K if need to send CQ again after working down the pile. Can also program the shorter one into auto-keyer as well.
