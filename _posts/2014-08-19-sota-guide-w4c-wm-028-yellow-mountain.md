####Trail Guide From Cole Gap via Shortoff Mountain

* **Duration**: 5.0 miles; 3:30 ascent (moderate pace); 3:00 return
* **Navigation**: 
    * Note: There is a trail sign that says you are 2.4 miles from the road with 2.4 miles to the summit remaining.  It is wrong.  It is 2.3 miles from the road with 2.7 miles remaining to the summit.
    * About 1/2 mile before the summit, you'll see gravel to your R.  You can stay on the trail, or shift over to the gravel road for the next 0.4 miles.  The road is for a failed-to-launch subdivision (as of August 2014). 
        * Another road from below will merge from the R in a bit.  You keep going up! 
* **Trailhead altitude**: 4270'
