####Drive Guide - Horsetrough Mountain

* **Duration**: 2:20
    * 1:40 from Perimeter Mall to Chattahoochee UMC.
    * 0:40 from Chattahoochee UMC to USFS-44C.
* **Google Maps** URL from Ashford Dunwoody Rd and I-285 at 33.91998, -84.33898: 
    * http://goo.gl/maps/Hl1Qr
    * WARNING: The Google Maps directions don't match up well with reality on the ground  after you leave 75A.  Use a good GPS.  I found it helpful to use the National Geographic topo app on an iPad, which showed me exactly where I was.
* **Seasonal/Limited Access**:
    * Poplar Stump Rd (a.k.a. USFS-44C) open ONLY 10/23-10/28, 11/16-11/26, 12/4-12/9
        * (As of 2013.04.06) If they really open the gate as scheduled, you should be able to drive a passenger car up part of it.  They did a planned burn to the south of the trail not too long ago, and it looks like they maintained the road at that time.  About half way up 44C, they cut another fire break to the left.  This is as far as you'll want to take a car.  You can take 4WD further up the road.
    * Part of the Chattahoochee River Rd (USFS-44) washed out and was closed in February 2013.  This map shows the approximate closed portion: [http://goo.gl/maps/51Yil](http://goo.gl/maps/51Yil).  
        * On the Unicoi Gap side, the road is open to provide access to Upper Chattahoochee Campground, and is gated at the first bridge past the campground.
            * From the north/east (via Wilks Rd at Unicoi Gap), the road is drivable by an ordinary passenger car to a point just past Upper Chattahoochee Campground (34.78646, -83.78294).  There's a bridge just past the campground with a locked gate.  The bridge is at 34.78472, -83.78202. That's about 1.3 miles short of the trailhead.  
            * The campground was open on Saturday, March 30, 2013.
        * On the other side, the road is open to 44C.  The gate on 44 is about 100 feet past 44C.  The road is drivable by an ordinary passenger car.
* **Directions**:
    * N on GA-400 and go 47 miles.
    * At end of 400 (@ GA-60) go straight onto GA-115. Go 4.8
    * GA-115 turns R.  (About 60 minute drive to this turn.) Go 11.4.
    * L on Tesnatee Gap Valley Rd. There's a left turn lane.  Go 2.8.
        * If you miss Tesnatee Gap Valley Rd, you *can* go through Helen to get to Poplar Stomp Gap Rd, but you'll drive through Helen.  (That's OK at 7 A.M., but it will be very congested later in the day. 
    * Go straight onto McAfee Rd. (Tesnatee turns left.)  Go 0.2
    * L on US-129 N at T. (About 1:15 total drive time to this turn.) Go 0.8.
    * R on GA-75A. Go 7.9.  (Pass Richard B Russell Scenic Hwy at 1:25 from trip start.)
    * L on Poplar Stump Rd at Chattahoochee United Methodist Church. (1:30 driving to here.) 
        * Road is marked as "Chattahoochee River Rd" on maps, shortly after this turn.
        * Go straight for 4.1 miles.
        * The road turns right and crosses a bridge.  
            * If you go straight, you'll enter Andrews Cove Campground, which was open on 2013.04.06.
        * 2.3 miles after you turned right, the road forks.  Keep right. (The left fork was gated when I drove here.)
        * 1.6 miles past the fork, the road turns sharply right and is gated.  You're at 44C (and just past Vandiver Branch).  The Forest Service informally calls this area "Vandiver Fields."  There were many park-by-the-side-of-the-road campers here on a spring Saturday.
    
* **Food**
    * Last McDonalds: GA-400 at GA-53 (38 miles north of I-285)
        * If you miss it, you can swing by 1550 S MAIN ST, Cleveland, adding 5 minutes.
    * Dinner
* **On the way home** (scouting/errands):  
    * None.  This is a tough hike.

####Trail Guide

* **Duration**: 3:15 -- about 3 miles. 2.4 trail miles and 0.6 bushwhack.
    * Total distance = 3 miles @ 3:00
        * Gain 1000 ft on road + trail to AT -- 1:10
            * 1.4 miles Poplar Stump Gap Rd (the road part)
            * 0.67 trail from Poplar Stump Gap Rd end to AT
            * Although it climbs continuously, the grade is moderate and not too taxing.  Once you pass the fire brake, it is a smooth surface, covered with short grass, and is beautiful.
        * 0.15 AT -- 0:05
        * 0.75 bushwhack @ 600 ft @ 0:55
        * Note: The hike down took LONGER. 2:20 total.  
            * It was a rough bushwhack (1:10) because I kept drifting west, which wore me out.  
            * An easy 5 minutes on the AT.
            I took some breaks coming down 44C (1:05).
* **Navigation**
    * Starting altitude = 2510' (Calibrate GPS altimeter)
    * Follow dirt road/trail shown on National Geographic map (and Delorme) to Poplar Stomp Gap
    * North on the AT 0.15 miles
    * Bushwhack north up the ridge to the summit of Horsetrough Mountain.
    * Note: When you come down the mountain, do not drift west. The terrain will cause you to drift west, and the route is tougher to the west.
* **GPS tracks/waypoints**:
