#### Trail Guide

* **Duration**: 30 minutes
* **Navigation**
    * Trailhead is behind the building with the vending machines.  Follow the signs.  It is a paved trail.
* **GPS tracks/waypoints**:
    * Visitor center parking lot 34.87014, -83.81000

#### Summit Guide

* Don't set up your antenna near the museum.  I had 10 minutes of good signal.  Then, something in the building started generating S9 QRM.  
* There is a little meadow with benches to your right, just as the trail reaches the summit.  I operated here.  I think it steers your signal heavily to the south and west. You could also set up near the handicapped parking.
* Hang antenna from tree: Possible.
* Space to guy mast: Yes
* Cell coverage: Very spotty.  I had to run up to the breezeway between buildings from the meadow where I was operating, in order to get either an AT&T signal or a Verizon signal.
* Unique features:
    * Museum on top.
* There are restrooms at the parking lot and the summit.  They were locked on March 30.  The explanation is that the Forest Service will turn on the water once freezing temperatures cease.
