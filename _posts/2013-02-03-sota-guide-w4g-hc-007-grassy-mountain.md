Trip-specific: Grassy Mtn - Drive to Trailhead & Trail Guide
--------------------------------------------------------
####Drive Guide - Grassy Mtn

* **Special**: Take cash ($2 in 2013) to pay parking fee.
* **Duration**: 2:15
* **Google Maps** URL from Ashford Dunwoody Rd and I-285: 
    * Via Ellijay: http://goo.gl/maps/W2jH9
    * Via Chattsworth: http://goo.gl/maps/DD1Ab
    * The last part of the map is not accurate because the road to the boat ramp is not known to Google.
* **SOTA Extra Info Page**: http://sotawatch.org/summits.php?summit=w4g/hc-007
* **Seasonal/Limited Access**:
    * Picnic and campground were closed in 2012.11.18 when I visited, but the boat ramp was open.
    * At the "Conasauga T" (34.84158, -84.59447), there's a gate blocking the right turn but not the left during the winter. A little ways up the road (past some cabins, there's a gate that might get closed in January and February.
* **Directions**:
    * Ellijay Route
        * 2:15 - based on experience
        * I-285 West
        * I-75 North

        * Go 0.5 past Ellijay McDonalds.
        * Left on 1st Ave, to cross bridge to Ellijay. Go 0.1

        * Ellijay downtown roundabout. Stay on 52.  Go 5.1
        * R on Gates Chapel Rd.  (There's a pond that you'll see once you turn onto Gates Chapel.)  Go 5.4.
        * Pavement ends at fork.  Bear R on Wilderness Trail. (Google calls it Wilderness Rd. Becomes FS90) Go 1.5.

        * **BALD MTN TRAILHEAD**: At this point, you are at the trailhead for Bald Mountain.
            * (Note to self: Don't delete this from the directions.  Bald Mtn directions just say to see these.)
        * Continue on FS 68 / Conasauga Rd.  See "Final Turns" below.
    * Chattsworth Route (I did this in November of 2012.  It is OK, but the Ellijay route is quicker.)

        * Right on Crandall Ellijay Rd.  Go 300 ft.
        * Left on Mill Creek Rd.
            * Google Maps makes it look like there are two Mill Creek Roads (as of November 2012). There aren't. The first one on Google is the real one.
        * Mill Creek Rd turns to dirt after a few tenths of a mile. 
            * As of November 2012, it is a good condition dirt road, about 1.5 lanes wide.
        * At 6.4 miles, stay left. (Right goes to a campground.)
        * Mill Creek Rd becomes known as FS-630.
        * Turn on GPS trace -- I want to capture the roads.
        * 8.6 miles, acute right onto FS-17 at 34.89911, -84.64720
            * Google calls it W. Cowpen Rd.
            * Google shows a T intersection (3-way). It is really a 4-way.
            * Dirt road going up-hill. About 1 lane wide. Go 3.2
                * There's a gate. It was open in mid-November.

        * At camping entrance, continue straight - do not turn R to "Camping Loop A."  **Go 0.6**.
            * Do NOT park in the campground.  They will ticket you.
        * Follow main road slightly to right.  (Don't turn left.) ** and go 0.2**.
        * At this point you can choose whether to hike the trail or the gravel road:
            * To gravel road route:
                * Continue straight onto road/trail 49 toward overflow camping and Windy gap Cycle Trail.  **Go 0.6**.
                * Park at the gate at the end of the road.  Hike the gravel road to the top.
            * To trail past the dam:
                * Bear R on 68A toward picnic and boat-launch areas.  Go 0.1.
                * The road to the boat ramp turns L on USFS-68C.  If picnic area is open, continue straight.  The picnic area was gated in November.
                    * Picnic area parking is in a few hundred feet.  It has flush toilets.
                    * If you go to the boat ramp:
                        * Park in parking area near (not at) the boat ramp.  No restroom in this area. GPS coordinates: 34.86002, -84.65275
                        * Walk the circum-lake trail counter-clockwise about 0.1 mile until you reach the dam. 
                    * The trail description begins from the dam.

    * Dinner
* **On the way home** (scouting/errands): Ellijay: Scout Burnt Mtn 
    * trailhead at 34.53747, -84.35771 (summit at 34.5347, -84.3615 is SW)
        * Monument Rd, off GA-136, may be private - Monument Rd, Jasper

####Trail Guide - Gravel Road From Overflow Camping ("Gravel Road")

* **Duration**: 0:40
* **Navigation**: Just follow the gravel road to the fire tower at the summit.


####Trail Guide - Hiking Trails Past the Dam ("Trails")

* **Duration**: 1:20
* **Navigation**
    * The hike took 1:20 going in and 47 minutes coming back. I was moving as fast as I could in both directions. (I was running late because the drive takes longer than Google estimates.)
    * The trail notes begin from the dam, at Lake Conasauga. There's a trail around the lake.
    * You want to start your hike proceeding counter-clockwise, from mid-dam.
    * At the end of the dam, turn right on trail 99.
    * Follow the trail. After a bit, it will head downhill. You'll find yourself wondering, "How will I make it to a fire tower by traveling downhill." It is a good trail, but in Fall, it can be a little indistinct, due to heavy leaf cover.
    * You'll come to a T, with a huge trail map sign. (You enter the T from the base.)
    * Turn right. Almost immediately, you'll cross a beaver dam.
    * Immediately after crossing the dam, take the trail to your left.
    * When Songbird and the Fire Tower trails split, take the right fork. It has a metal post with "99" on it.
    * When you pass a large boulder on your right, in a small valley, look right. The trail makes a 90 degree right turn here. Hikers sometimes miss this turn. When I hiked it in November 2012, the Blaze Fairy had tagged occasional trees with small, bright green, metal tags. This turn is marked, but vandals sometimes remove blazes.
    * After a long, up-hill slog, you'll join the grassy dirt road, running up the ridge to the fire tower.
    * There's a big clearing at the fire tower. It is a short, wide tower.

####Summit Guide

* Hang antenna from tree: Yes, around edges of clearing.
* Space to guy mast: Yes.
* Cell coverage: 
    * AT&T=Intermittent.  It came and went.  I did get a SMS self-spot, but it was tough.  Try different areas on the summit and try facing different directions.
    * Verizon=Intermittent, but it worked eventually.
    * APRS send/receive = Succeeded
* Unique features: Short, squat fire tower.  Beaver dam on trail.
* Note that there are flush toilets at the picnic area at Lake Conasauga.  You have to pay $2 to park there, and don't forget that the picnic area isn't open for the full March-December season that the road is open.


####Plan-B Candidates
