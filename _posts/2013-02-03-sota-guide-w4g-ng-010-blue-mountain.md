Trip-specific: Drive to Trailhead & Trail Guide
--------------------------------------------------------
####Drive Guide

* **Duration**: 2:00 (actual, 1/5/2013)
* **Google Maps** URL from I-285 at 33.91819, -84.33747: http://goo.gl/maps/f8Pdz
* **Seasonal/Limited Access**: All seasons; all weather.
* **Directions**:
    * Google Maps offers 3 routes with similar time profiles.  We stayed on 985 as long as possible on the way up.  We came back via Cleveland.  They were about the same. 
    * I-285 E
    * I-85 N
    * 985-N (becomes GA-365) and go 51.8
    * L on GA-384 N and go 15.6.
    * R on GA-75 N and go 12.4.
    * Park in the big lot on the right at Unicoi Gap.  The gap is marked with a roadside sign.
    * There are no dirt roads involved in getting there.  High ground clearance vehicle is NOT required.
    * The trail is across the road from the parking. Do be careful crossing the gap on foot.  There is *very* little time between hearing a car and having it bear down on you.
* **Food**
    * Last McDonalds: 
    * Penultimate McDonalds: 
    * Dinner
* **On the way home** (scouting/errands):
    * Not this time.

####Trail Guide

* **Duration**: 1:10 (actual, 1/5/2013)
* **Navigation**
    * The AT is easy to follow.  From a navigation perspective, this is a piece of cake.  Park on one side of the highway, take the obvious trail on the other side of the highway, and follow it until there is no more 'up' to climb.
    * Some maps show about a 1.1 mile hike.  Not a chance. My GPS says we walked 1.6 miles.  The maps don't show some big switchbacks.  It was about a 15% grade, so it was not a 'walk in the park.'
    * Portions of the trail require hiker agility.  There are sections of the trail composed almost entirely of large rocks.  If you're frail, this is not a good hike.
* **GPS tracks/waypoints**:
    * GPS waypoints are not provided for this trip.  The trail is 100% obvious and it is well blazed.  Just pay attention at the double blazes, which will ensure you don't miss a switchback.

####Summit Guide

* Hang antenna from tree: Easy
* Space to guy mast: Good
* Cell coverage: Marginally adequate.  Came and went. I did get off an SMS.  Web browsing was difficult.
* Unique features:
    * Busy section of Appalachian Trail.

####Plan-B Candidates

* None provided.  You really won't need a Plan-B.  The road is paved all the way there, and the trail is easy to find/follow.
