Kirchhoff came up with two laws.  They pretty much say the same thing: Everything going out is matched by everything coming in.  No exceptions.

* Kirchhoff's Voltage law (KVL): The total of voltages leaving **a node** must be matched by the total of voltages entering **the node**.
* Kirchhoff's Current law (KCL): The total of currents leaving **a node** must be matched by the total of currents entering **the node**.
