    * Google shows a left turn onto USFS-64.  It is actually straight.  
       * A left turn is straight down the mountain.  (Straight is as 'left' as you can go.)

#### Summit Guide

* Hang antenna from tree: Yes
* Space to guy mast: Yes, if you're flexible.
* Cell coverage: Good signal.
* Unique features:
    * Nice view through bare trees in winter.
    * A fairly sharp, well-defined peak for Georgia.

#### Plan-B Candidates

* Flat Top Mountain
* Dyer is really a "Plan-B" for other hills in the area.  With its short hike and all-weather road access, it is a good second choice when you can't get to your primary destination.
