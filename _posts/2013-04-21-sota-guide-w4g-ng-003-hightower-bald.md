Trip-specific: Drive to Trailhead & Trail Guide
--------------------------------------------------------
####Drive Guide - Hightower Bald (Southern Approach) from Atlanta

* **Duration**: 2:15
* **Google Maps** from Ashford Dunwoody Rd  I-285 at 33.91998, -84.33898: http://goo.gl/maps/yFSRF
* **Seasonal/Limited Access**: Unknown
* **Directions**:
    * I made it to the 2WD trailhead in a Prius.  Using both a Prius and a Corolla, I was unable to make it past an erosion ditch shortly after this point.  I got hung-up on my trailer hitch and had to rock the car to get out.
    * Take a good street-capable GPS and pre-load maps, if necessary.  You'll want it for your final approach, where Google Maps and reality diverge.
    * N on GA-400 and go 47 miles.
    * At end of 400 (@ GA-60) go straight onto GA-115. Go 4.8
    * GA-115 turns R.  (About 60 minute drive to this turn.) Go 11.4.
    * L on Tesnatee Gap Valley Rd. There's a left turn lane.  Go 2.8.
    * Go straight onto McAfee Rd. (Tesnatee turns left.)  Go 0.2
    * L on US-129 N at T. (About 1:15 total drive time to this turn.) Go 0.8.
    * R on GA-75A. Go 8.2.
    * L on GA-75 and go 16.6
    * Stop -- Make sure all of your GPS are turned on and you're tracking your route.
    * R on GA-2/US-76E and go 5.2.
    * The final approach to the trailhead (about 15 minutes):
        * L on Upper Hightower Rd (sign to Mt Pleasant Church of God) and go 1.6
        * Upper Hightower Rd makes a 90 degree left turn; follow it. Go 1.6.
        * Road becomes 1 lane and loses the center stripe.  About this point, it forks, and the left fork is Jack Branch Rd.  Stay to the right.  Go 0.2.
        * There is a gravel road to the right. Do NOT take it.  Go 0.2.
        * Fork to left is marked private. Keep right.  Go 0.1.
        * Park at wide spot in road.  Room for 3-4 cars.  There's a buried-fiber-optic post marking the spot.
        * This is 0.7 miles before the AT.  
    * IF you have 4WD and high ground clearance (HGC), you can drive farther.  
        * You'll find some 2 foot deep erosion gullies.  You could tip your vehicle if you're not careful.
        * I recommend against driving all the way to the trailhead in a 2WD SUV or a 4WD passenger car (like the Subaru Forester).  You want big tires *and* 4WD.    If you have *either* 4WD or HGC, you might try driving a little farther.  
        * Be prepared to back out, if necessary.
* **Food**
    * Last McDonalds: GA-53 on GA-400.
        * There is a McDonalds in Hiawasee that opens at 6 AM 7 days a week, but it is out of your way.

####Drive Guide - Hightower Bald (Northern Approach) from Atlanta

I don't know if there *is* a feasible approach from the North.  These are notes on how it might be done.

* **Duration**: 2:20
* **Google Maps** from Ashford Dunwoody Rd  I-285 at 33.91998, -84.33898: https://goo.gl/maps/gAFvCwDTBjA2
* **Seasonal/Limited Access**: Unknown
* **Directions**:
    * Ryan says you can drive to the end of Eagle Fork Rd at 35.007268, -83.622564.
    * Blye Gap Rd is gated at 35.011715, -83.626984 


####Trail Guide - Approach from the South

* UPDATE: This thread says Charlies Creek Rd was repaired in 2015.
* UPDATE: As of June 2016, I drove from Upper Hightower Rd to the first part of Charlies Creek Rd in a Corolla, but was unable to drive to Blue Ridge Gap.  The road was too steep and I could not get traction to climb the hill.  This is currently drivable in a light 4WD such as a Forrester.  They did not re-engineer the road, so runoff is cutting erosion ditches quickly.  It won't be long before a Jeep-type 4WD will again be required.

* **Duration**: 
    * To the summit: 4:35 (5.1 miles) - one way (per my trip of 2013.04.20)
    * From the summit to car: 4:40 (per my trip of 2013.04.20)
* **Navigation**
    * GPS is essential for this hike.
    * Bushwhacking strategy: 
        * Once you leave the AT, you'll want to navigate from gap to peak to gap to peak...
        * I tried to traverse some hills, to skirt the peak.  This was a mistake.  It was slow and very hard on the knees and ankles.  When you're in a gap, hike straight up to the top of the next peak.  When you're on a peak, follow the ridge line down to the next gap.  (Make sure you follow the *correct* ridge line.  Some peaks have multiple ridges, and I started down a wrong one.)
        * Follow ridge lines between gaps and peaks. 
            * If you find yourself 10 yards off the ridge line, try and get back onto it.  I regretted it when I diverged from the ridge.
            * If you find yourself 25 yards off the ridge line, take your trekking poles, whack yourself over the head in penance, and get back on the ridge line.
            * The final 1/4 mile (approximate) approach to Hightower Bald is overgrown with dense vegetation.  You may *have to* skirt this.  I did.  Regaining the ridge line was a LOT of work. I followed the faint trail as it went slightly downhill to avoid this vegetation. Then, at some point, I said, "Too much downhill," and headed straight up the hill.  I then encountered another faint trail and followed it for a bit until I was about 30 feet from the apex.  I then went straight up to the summit and found the 10 foot semi-clearing.  You might do better by staying closer to the ridge as you skirt the vegetation.  I think I followed the trail longer than optimal.
        * There is a faint trail on much of the ridge lines.
    * You can read stories on the web about how difficult this bushwhack is. For the route I describe, it is a *strenuous* hike, but only the last quarter mile or so has really bad vegetation.  There was a *small* (10') relatively clear spot at the summit.
    * I did this trip on April 20, 2013.  Spring 'greening' was just staring.  Vegetation will be much worse in summer.  I recommend making this trek after Daylight Saving Time begins (for the longer days) and no later than I did.  Brittle winter vegetation is easier to bushwhack than lush summer growth.
    * Recommended route:
        * 0.8 miles, climb 625' [30 minutes] - Follow Charlies Creek Rd from parking to the AT.
        * 3 miles, climb 810' [2 hours] - Follow AT to the north (left).
        * Leave AT on the *north* side of Rich Knob, before Bly Gap.
        * 1.3 miles, climb 1000' (net 660') Bushwhack to HTB [2 hours]
* **Trailhead altitude**: 2433' @ 2WD parking @ 34.95928, -83.60615
* **Summit altitude**: 4588'
* **GPS tracks/waypoints**:
    * Trailhead (AT): 34.95869, -83.59622
    * Leave AT: 34.98682, -83.59916
    * Hightower Bald: 34.9848, -83.6202

####Trail Guide - Approach from the North

I don't know if there *is* a feasible approach from the North.  These are notes on how it might be done.

* **Duration**: 
    * 1.8 miles of hiking along old road plus 0.8 to 1.2 miles of bushwhack.
* **Navigation**
    * From the gate at the fork of Eagle Fork Rd and Blye Gap Rd at 35.011715, -83.626984, follow Blye Gap Rd along the north side of Dave Barrett Creek (DBC).
        * DBC runs mostly to the east.  There are 3 streams which branch to the southeast from DBC.
            * Loggy Branch is the first.
            * Sugar Cove is the middle. (Unnamed on Google.)
            * Barrett Branch is 3rd.
            * My Garmin GPS has a properly labeled dot where each stream branches off DBC, but the streams are mislabeled and the 3rd stream is not shown as a blue line.
            * Ryan emailed an image to me which shows a map with all 3 at 9:28 PM on 2016.06.19.  (Search for "Satellite photos that Blye Gap Rd".)
    * At 35.006258, -83.611714, Blye Gap Rd crosses Dave Barrett Creek and forks.
        * The right fork heads southwest and then follows Sugar Cove and shows up on Google.  
        * Take the left fork south, then turning east, following the south side of DBC.
        * After crossing Barret Branch, you'll be between DBC and Barrett Branch, and the road quality degrades.  Follow this along Barret Branch about 0.1 miles, keeping Barrett Branch to your right.
        * Follow the trail/road about another 0.1 as it drifts away from Barret Branch.
        * A trail forks off to the right.  Follow this up the draw containing Barret Branch. (Garmin eventually shows this draw as containing a short "Intermittent Stream").  There will be some switchbacks in the last 1/2 of this trail, before it reaches Bly Gap.

####Summit Guide

* Hang antenna from tree: not good. You could snake a wire from tree to tree.
* Space to guy mast: Not really.  I bungeed a mast to a tree.
* Cell coverage: Yes.  Adequate AT&T signal.  Good Verizon/Pagenet signal.
* Unique features: Very, very strenuous bushwhack.


####Plan-B Candidates

* Bell Knob
