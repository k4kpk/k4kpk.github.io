Commentary:

Despite some ominous gray clouds (and some gnats, which briefly drove my 13 year-old son nuts), we had a great time activating Wildcat Mountain (W4G/NG-020).  It is always nice to have my son along.  As I've mentioned before, he is the perfect trail companion: he keeps up, he doesn't complain, he doesn't natter, and he helps with antenna setup and with contact logging.

This is a brief hike at 35 minutes in and 25 minutes out.  (We *hustled*, coming out.)  The climb from the gap to the junction with the Whitley Gap Shelter trail is steep, but there are no large obstacles, and it is brief, at 0.2 miles.  The side trail is blue-blazed and a pleasant walk.  We were there before the laurel blooms, but I bet that will be pretty.  There are some nice views along the way.

I had a little trouble with my "10 Meter Mini GRP Mast" from [http://www.dx-wire.de/brit/](http://www.dx-wire.de/brit/).  Although I *thought* I had firmly extended each section, it collapsed (section sliding into section) on me as I was setting it up.  I usually just pull firmly to extend segments, having read that twisting can eventually cause de-lamination.  This time I had to do some twisting, to make it stay extended.  Also, I discovered that the threaded end cap was split.  I suspect it was damaged when it was shipped to me, but since I didn't notice it until I'd had the mast out a couple of times, I can't say for certain.

We had a good turn out of chasers for a weekday on SSB, with both old and new friends on the contacts.  Thank you chasers!
