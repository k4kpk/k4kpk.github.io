### Summit Activated -  W4G/HC-007, Grassy Mountain, Georgia
Perfect weather, beautiful site, intermediate-level hike.  Lotsa driving on dirt roads.

Competing for bandwidth with the ARRL's Sweepstakes contest was brutal.  I briefly found an unused frequency, but I wasn't able to hold it for long.  After a few minutes, there was a contester who couldn't hear my 5 watts.  One of my contacts announced that the frequency *IS* in use (thanks!), but I don't think the contester heard him either.  

17 meters was also pretty busy, but made a good alternate.

## Contacts ##
* 5 QSO at 5 watts on 17 meters - 18.1385 MHz SSB
* 5 QSO at 5 watts on 20 meters - 14.285 MHz SSB

Thank you chasers!

## Radio ##
* Elecraft KX3


## Antennas ##
* Easy site for antennas.
    * Throw wires in a tree - use low trees around the clearing.
    * Tie a wire to the tower.
    * There aren't any really tall trees.
    * Big clear area at the end of the road.  Warning: You may need to pound stakes with a rock.  The roadbed is dense.
* Antennas I used:
    * 20 meters - EFHW on 31' Jackite with EARCHI 20 meter matchbox. Guyed it in the roadbed.
    * 17 meters - W3EDP - run through the trees.  Twin-lead followed by single strand of speaker wire.  I used my mast poles to push it into the trees.

I'd like to further refine my antenna arsenal for better 17 meter coverage.  I used a W3EDP for 17 meters, and this is suboptimal.  Maybe next time I'll carry EFHW wires for 20 and 17, and just drop and re-raise my mast in between.

I erected my Jackite in the clearing, away from my W3EDP.  I wanted to experiment with both antennas.  For non-experimenting use, I could have simply leaned my Jackite into a tree.  (That's what I did with the mast supporting my W3EDP.)
    
## Cell Phone Coverage ##
* Intermittent cell coverage is available at the fire tower, using my iPhone 3gs.  Sometimes I got 3 bars; sometimes I got "No Signal."  I did manage to SOTA-spot via SMS.  Coverage seemed best at WNW in the parking circle, facing NW.  Sit.  Be patient.
* Cell towers exist in Eton, perhaps because of the large carpet mills.
* There's a cell tower along the brief stretch of Crandal Ellijay road you'll drive.

## Getting There - Driving ##
* Reset your odometer at each turn.  
* Note: Another valid route, about as good is http://goo.gl/maps/iiV2r and it has lots in common with routes to some other hills I've done.  ("Familiar" is good.)
* Driving north on 411 from McDonald's in Chattsworth, GA.
  ** Total drive time from here to trailhead parking is about 60 minutes.  You can do it in 5 minutes less if you drive too fast on dirt roads.  It will take much longer if you get behind a drives-slow-on-dirt-roads driver.
* **5.9 miles**, turn right on Grassy St  (just past the Eton Post Office).
* **0.4 miles**, turn right on Crandall Ellijay Rd
* **300 ft**, turn left on Mill Creek Rd.
    * Google Maps makes it look like there are two Mill Creek Roads (as of November 2012).  There aren't.  The first one on Google is the real one.
    * Mill Creek Rd turns to dirt after a few tenths of a mile.  As of November 2012, it is a good condition dirt road, about 1.5 lanes wide.
    * At 6.4 miles, stay left.  (Right goes to a campground.)
    * Mill Creek Rd becomes known as FS-630.
* **8.6 miles**, acute right onto FS-17 at 34.89911, -84.64720
    * Google calls it W. Cowpen Rd.
    * Google shows a T intersection (3-way).  It is really a 4-way.
    * Dirt road going up-hill. About 1 lane wide.  There's a gate.  It was open for me in mid-November.
* **3.2 miles**, turn right onto FS-68.  (Google calls it Conasauga Lake Rd)
* You'll come to a T, with overflow camping to your left.  Go right, toward the campground.
* Don't park in the campground.
* Continue past the campground entrance a bit and take the marked right turn toward the picnic/boat-launch areas.  Picnic is the preferred parking area for day use.  There's a gate.  It was closed in mid-November.
* Continue a bit and turn right, to the boat launch ramp.
* Park in the small lot, just before the ramp.  GPS coordinates: 34.86002, -84.65275
* Walk the circum-lake trail counter-clockwise about 0.1 mile until you reach the dam.  The trail description begins from the dam.

Total drive time from Perimeter Mall in Atlanta was 2:40.  That's a "best case" drive time.

Google Maps makes it look like you can drive up to the fire tower.  The road is gated.  Only Forest Service trucks get to drive there.

## Getting There - Hiking ##
The trail notes begin from the dam, at Lake Conasauga.  There's a trail around the lake.  You want to start your hike proceeding counter-clockwise, from mid-dam.

The hike took 1:20 going in and 47 minutes coming back.  I was moving as fast as I could in both directions.  (I was running late because the drive takes longer than Google estimates.)

* At the end of the dam, turn right on trail 99.
* Follow the trail.  After a bit, it will head downhill.  You'll find yourself wondering, "How will I make it to a fire tower by traveling downhill."  It is a good trail, but in Fall, it can be a little indistinct, due to heavy leaf cover.
* You'll come to a T, with a huge trail map sign.  (You enter the T from the base.)  
* Turn right.  Almost immediately, you'll cross a beaver dam.
* Immediately after crossing the dam, take the trail to your left.
* When Songbird and the Fire Tower trails split, take the right fork.  It has a metal post with "99" on it.
* When you pass a large boulder on your right, in a small valley, look right.  The trail makes a 90 degree right turn here.  Hikers sometimes miss this turn.  When I hiked it in November 2012, the Blaze Fairy had tagged occasional trees with small, bright green, metal tags.  This turn is marked, but vandals sometimes remove blazes.
* After a long, up-hill slog, you'll join the grassy dirt road, running up the ridge to the fire tower.
* There's a big clearing at the fire tower.  It is a short, wide tower.
