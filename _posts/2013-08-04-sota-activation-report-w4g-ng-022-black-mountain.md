Commentary:

After I activated Big Cedar Mountain, I hiked back to Woody Gap. The sky was blue and I headed up to Black Mountain.  I'd saved it to last because it has a dirt road, and I wanted easy navigation in case I had to hike out at dusk.  

I'd read another activator who complained that it was a tough hike.  As I walked the first half, I was thinking, "This is a piece of cake."  Then I rounded the turn (there's only one), the trail went up, and up...  At one point I was reduced to, "Take 20 steps, rest for 20, take 20 steps..."  It was 90 degrees, 90 percent humidity, and mostly sunny.  I had already hiked 3 summits beforehand, so it might not be so tiring for a fresh hiker.

As the summit came into view, it started to cloud over.  As I started unpacking, I thought I heard a rumble and decided to go with my 'quick' antenna.  Within minutes, the sky was dark, the thunder was near, and the wind was picking up.  I briefly considered putting up a tarp and trying to wait out the storm, but since it was late in the day I wasn't sure there would be enough light. Time to flee without activating.  It was raining as I hustled down that hill it took so long to climb.

I'm glad I fled because shortly after I reached my car the wind was really blowing and it was raining so hard I could only drive about 15 MPH.  That turned out to be a good thing.  As I rounded a corner there was a tree across the highway.

I had been hoping for my 30th activation on this expedition, but he who summits and runs away lives to activate again another day.  ;-)

Commentary:

I activated W4G/NG-022, Black Mountain today.  This was a much nicer trip than in July when I got chased off the mountain by a thunderstorm.  

That one was tough because it was hot, it was an extra hill tacked on after other activations, and I was in a hurry.  Today, it was my only summit, the weather was cool, and the weather forecast was good, so I meandered up the hill.  The summit showed up in no time and it was a nice walk.

There's a communications tower on top, with a small clearing to the north and a larger clearing to the south.  I went with the southern clearing.

I set up an EARCHI 6-40 end-fed, with the feed point 24' up a mast and the far end a little higher.  I had some trouble with a loose connection.  Every time the mast shook, I had loose-wire QRN.  'Dunno whether it was the feed or the antenna connector.  Having a connection "up there" is a down-side of an elevated feed point. 

I can't say that I saw a better signal with an elevated horizontal than with a vertical on the mast.  Certainly not enough to be worth the extra effort.

There was some thunderstorm noise -- more on 40 than on 20.  There were a couple of contacts I couldn't pull out of the noise.  (Sorry about that.)  Thank you chasers!
