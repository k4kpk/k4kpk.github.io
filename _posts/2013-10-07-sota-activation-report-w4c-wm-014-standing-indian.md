Commentary:

My activation was a comedy of errors.

Off to the side the approach road, I saw a small SUV had tumbled off the road.  It was a few days old, with a sign taped to the (exposed) bottom that had been rained on.  I figured it was old enough that the rescue had happened days ago.  I didn't stop, but I did take it as a reminder to drive carefully.  It wasn't a gnarly road, nor was there any obvious obstacle at that point.  Maybe the drive of that vehicle or a vehicle he encountered was going too fast for a dirt road...

It was a beautiful early-fall day, with 0% chance of rain.  The drive took longer than I expected and I had a second summit planned for the day, so I hiked up the trail as fast as I could.  It is an easy trail to follow.

There's a grassy clearing with a nice view on top.  I guyed a mast with a vertical EFHW.  The first thing I always do is to send an SMS from both of my phones (AT&T and Verizon) to a special address I have set up.  This gives me a permanent record as to whether SMS is available on a site.  I have set up address book entries cleverly named "SOTA-Coverage" for this purpose.

When I was ready to activate, I sent my SMS to self-spot.  Then I called CQ.  Nothingâ€¦  So I sent another SMS and called CQ some more.  Nada.  I checked my antenna, my feed line, my SWR, my power.  Again an SMS.  And some more CQ.  Crickets.

"I'm not getting out," I thought.  So I got on the HT.  I can never raise more than a couple of people on VHF.  Today, I made 3 S2S, plus I tail-ended a home station.  Activation rescued.  A couple of my S2S were to teen-agers on nearby summits, so that was unusual. (They both did a FB.)

Then I realized I'd been sending my spots to "SOTA-Coverage" in my phone's address book and not "SOTA-Spot."  Oops!  No wonder nobody heard me.  I then had a fine session on 20m.

For 40m, I usually replace the EFHW matchbox with a balun, and run a low radial/dipole-leg to balance the 1/4 wave vertical.  Today, my balun fell apart in my hands.  I rigged up something with alligator clips, but it wasn't effective and I made no contacts on 40.
