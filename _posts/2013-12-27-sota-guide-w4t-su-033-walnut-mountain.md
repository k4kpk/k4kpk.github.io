Trip-specific: Drive to Trailhead & Trail Guide
--------------------------------------------------------
####Drive Guide - Walnut Mountain from Max Patch parking lot

* **Duration**: 0:15
* **Google Maps** URL from Knoxville to Max Patch to Walnut to Knoxville: http://goo.gl/maps/20ybb
* **Seasonal/Limited Access**:
* **Directions**:
    * North on Max Patch Rd (Turn R, exiting parking lot) and go 3.6
    * USFS-3505 (AKA Rattlesnake Branch Rd) road Ts in from right at Lemon Gap.  AT crosses it.
    * Park at AT crossing at Lemon Gap.
* **Food**
    * Last McDonalds: n.a.

####Trail Guide

* **Duration**: 1.4 miles, 1:20
* **Navigation**
    * Follow AT 1.25 North to Walnut Mtn shelter at 35.8365,-82.93649
    * Follow faint trail past shelter, to left of AT, 0.2 to summit at 35.8367, -82.9341
    * Note: Shelter is about 50' elevation below summit, as measured by my GPS.
* **Trailhead altitude**: 3550
* **Summit altitude**: 4300
* **GPS tracks/waypoints**:
    * Trailhead: 35.82536, -82.93744
    * Creek crossing (dry in boots; wet in sneakers): 35.83346,-82.93664
    * Shelter: 35.83651,-82.93644
    * Summit: 35.83670,-82.93410

####Alternate Route####
* Drive to Rattlesnake Gap at 35.848, -82.944 via USFS-96 (see Round Mtn Guide).  
* USFS-96 comes into a T at Rattlesnake Gap.  96 turns R on the top-right of the T.  
* There's another dirt road that ends inside the right-turn of 96.  Standing in the gap, face SE and walk toward 35.847824, -82.94429.
* It looks like this may be a trail up to the Walnut Mountain shelter.  There is a sign near the shelter that points to a well-defined trail marked "Rattlesnake Gap 0.9 miles".  
* Based on the topo, this would be about 100' less climb than from Lemon Gap.

####Summit Guide

* Hang antenna from tree: yes
* Space to guy mast: yes
* Cell coverage: ATT=no; Vzn=no 2013; Vzn=yes 2014; APRS=yes
