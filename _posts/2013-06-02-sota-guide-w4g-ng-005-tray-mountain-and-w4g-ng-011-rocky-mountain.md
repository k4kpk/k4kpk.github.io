Tray Mountain Guide
--------------------------------------------------------

* Update: 2016.05 - Tray Mtn Rd from the junction with Indian Grave Gap Rd to Tray Gap is deeply rutted and unsafe to drive in a sedan. Deep ruts, big rocks. Note to self - **Don't do it!**
* Corbin Creek Rd is 10.1 miles and 45 minutes to Tray Gap.  Corbin Creek Rd is rough but not "Wonder Mode".
* Back in 2012 I was told that Tray Gap Road *beyond* the gap (i.e. the right fork at the gap) is deeply rutted and unsuitable for 2WD.
* Either take the long, rough drive up Corbin Creek Rd or park at Indian Grave Gap and hike an extra 1.7 miles one-way.


NOTE: **Do not drive through Helen.  Traffic is often 2 MPH. **

    * Condition of road from junction with Indian Grave Gap Rd to Tray Gap varies from year to year.  Sometimes it is drivable in a sedan; sometimes it really needs 4WD + HGC.
    * Gates at both ends of IGG Rd.  Season is unknown. No gates on TM Rd. 
* **Directions**:
    * Getting to near the destination:
        * N on GA-400 and go 47 miles.
        * At end of 400 (@ GA-60) go straight onto GA-115. Go 4.8
        * GA-115 turns R.  (About 60 minute drive to this turn.) Go 11.4.
        * L on Tesnatee Gap Valley Rd. There's a left turn lane.  Go 2.8.
        * Go straight onto McAfee Rd. (Tesnatee turns left.)  Go 0.2

        * R on GA-75A. Go 8.0.  (Pass Richard B Russell Scenic Hwy at 1:25 from trip start.)
        * From intersection of GA-75A and GA-75, on GA-75 go north
    * Final approach (60 minutes - tell Google Maps to take you to 34.79921, -83.69089.  This is much slower that Google estimates.):
        * Watch for mile marker 8.  ~ 0.2 to TM Rd.
        * Watch for brown house on left, close to road, with no windows. TM Rd imminent.
        * R on Tray Mountain Rd.  Small, thin sign "Bison View Lodge".
        * After about 15 minutes, large gate made of black logs on right. "No trespassing".
        * 5 more minutes to junction w/IGG Rd.  Keep right on Tray Mountain RD (USFS-79).
        * 10 more minutes to Tray Gap. Roads to L and R with AT in center.  (Both roads un-gated.)
* **Food**
    * Last McDonalds: GA-400 at GA-53 (38 miles north of I-285)
        * If you miss it, you can swing by 1550 S MAIN ST, Cleveland, adding 5 minutes.

#### Drive Guide - Tray Mountain (Indian Grave Gap trailhead) from YELLOW BALD

* **Duration**: 2:00.  Although Tray Mtn Rd is SLOW, the roads near Yellow Bald are very good. 
* **Directions**
    * Note: This is a very good quality dirt road.

    * L on Allison Creek Rd / Old Murphy Rd and go 1.9
    * L on US-64 West and go 16.4
        * Note: You will briefly pick-up a 3G AT&T signal, about 2 miles before you leave 64.  This would be a good time to get Google Maps to route you to your destination.  (I needed it because the road had been re-routed.)
    * L on NC-175 S and go 0.8.  Turn R to cross bridge, staying on NC-175 and go 3.4 more.
    * S on GA-75 S and go 3.5

#### Summit Guide

* For the view, stop at the summit.  For a better operating site, continue about 1/10 mile to a campsite, which I measured to be within the activation zone.
* Hang antenna from tree: 
    * Poor on the summit (mostly dwarf trees & Rhodadendron); 
    * Very nice at the campsite.
* Space to guy mast: 
    * Challenging on the summit (I did bungee a mast to shrubs)
    * Better at the campsite.
* Cell coverage: Good AT&T and Verizon; APRS text worked (on the summit - did not test at campsite)
* Unique features: Nice view.  Easy to find benchmark on summit.


#### Miscellaneous Notes

* I drove Indian Grave Gap Rd in a Corolla with no problems in dry weather.  Don't drive too fast - there are some surprise potholes and runoff gullies.  The ford on IGG Rd went OK in a dry week.  Don't try it after heavy rain. Maintain momentum crossing the creek, to avoid trouble climbing out.
* There is a very weak Internet/data connection in Tray Gap.
