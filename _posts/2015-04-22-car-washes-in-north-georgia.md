When I head out for SOTA and the trip includes dirt roads, I take my wife's car, because it has higher ground clearance.  I need a good car wash on the way home!

There are three primary arteries to north Georgia:

* **I-575**
    * Canton GA - 301 Adams Jenkins Memorial Dr, Canton, GA 30115
* **GA-400**
    * GA-141:  Head west on GA-141 and it is on the right after a few hundred yards.  It is called "Wave", and it is next to the daycare.
* **GA-985**
    * Clayton: Ingles, across from Chic-fil-a and next to BP, on East side of 441, just north of hwy 76West turn-off, has a very nice car wash at its gas station.
    * Gainesville: 3 miles off I-985 = 1238 Jesse Jewell Pkwy SW, Gainesville, GA. Exit on GA-60 North, turning L at end of ramp.  Go L at Jesse Jewell Pky and "Extreme Car Wash" is on R in 0.6 miles.
