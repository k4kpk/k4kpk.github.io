These are summits I recommend for beginners (or just when you want a low-effort activation) in North Carolina.

* [W4C/CM-001, Mt Mitchell](/content/sota-guide-w4ccm-001-mt-mitchell)
    * All paved-road drive; short walk to summit on paved trail; observation deck.  Note: I got hassled by a park clean-up guy, so set up out of the way and be sure to carry your license.
* [W4C/CM-005, Black Balsam Knob](/content/sota-guide-w4ccm-005-black-balsam-knob)
    * In my opinion, this is the most beautiful summit in the southeast.  If the weather is pretty, drop whatever you are doing and get up there.
* [W4C/CM-036, Max Patch](/content/sota-guide-w4ccm-036-max-patch)
    * Short hike; view, view, and more view.  This is one of my favorite summits.
* [W4C/WM-001, Clingmans Dome](/content/sota-guide-w4cwm-001-clingmans-dome)
    * All paved-road drive; short walk; observation deck on summit; Technician: should be possible to raise 4 VHF contacts from Knoxville; view.
* [W4C/WM-003, Richland Balsam](/content/sota-guide-w4cwm-003-richland-balsam)
    * All paved-road drive; short walk.  I don't know why, but I really like the 'feel' of this summit.
* [W4C/WM-004, Waterrock Knob](/content/sota-guide-w4cwm-004-waterrock-knob)
    * All paved-road drive; short walk; restrooms at trailhead; view.
* [W4C/WM-011, Huckleberry Knob](/content/sota-guide-w4cwm-011-huckleberry-knob)
    * All paved-road drive; easy trail to follow; view.  This is one of my favorite summits.
* [W4C/WM-042, Whiteside Mountain](/content/w4cwm-042-whiteside-mountain)
    * All paved-road drive; easy to follow trail; view.
* [W4C/WM-055, Barnett Knob](/content/sota-guide-w4cwm-055-barnett-knob)
    * Easy walk; all paved-road drive; climbable fire tower on top.
