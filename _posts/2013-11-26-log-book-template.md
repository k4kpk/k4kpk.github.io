[The attachment](http://k4kpk.com/sites/k4kpk.com/files/Logbook%20Template.xlsx) is an Excel spreadsheet which I print and use to capture log book entries when I'm portable (whether SOTA or picnic-in-the-park or Field Day or...)

I fold it in half and clip it to a VFR flying kneeboard, to keep the wind from blowing it away.
