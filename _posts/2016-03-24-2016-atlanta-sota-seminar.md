The second annual Atlanta SOTA Seminar will take place on June 9 and 11.

The seminar is designed to help aspiring SOTA activators and chasers get started.  On June 9, we will hold an online training session from 7:30 to 9:30 to prepare and plan for our activation.  On June 11, we will activate Black Mountain [W4G/NG-022](/content/sota-guide-w4gng-022-black-mountain).  The training is open to hams interested in activating (operating from the summit) and chasing (contacting activators from the comfort of the shack).

### Topics

* How to register for SOTA
* How to post an activation alert
