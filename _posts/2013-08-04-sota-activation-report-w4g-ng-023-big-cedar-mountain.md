Commentary:

Woody Gap is on GA-60, and easy to find.  Lots of parking, but lots of hikers/bikers/picnickers on weekends. 

If you go there, watch out! There's lots of poison ivy on that summit.  I went off trail, to activate from the true high point.  There was lots of thunderstorm QRN, but a good number of chasers persisted through the noise and my weak signal.  

Given the poison ivy and the fact that the high point of the **trail** is within the activation zone, I'll operate from the side of the trail when I go back.   I was observed by a doe for part of my activation, so that was unusual.
