title: Tallest SOTA Summits in Georgia
---

Sometimes it is fun to say something like, "I want to activate the tallest summits in Georgia."

[This site](https://georgia-atclub.org/georgia-4000/georgia-4000-foot-peaks) lists tallest summits in Georgia, per the AT club.  But not all of them are SOTA summits, because they lack the necessary prominence of 150 meters (492 feet). 

Note that different sources identify different elevations and prominence.  Lists of John is the standard used when the Georgia association was created.  We sometimes wind up with a foot or so of difference because SOTA uses meters, and rounding out and back sometimes creates some fuzz.

**To the best of my ability, these are the SOTA summits in Georgia at or above 4000'**.
