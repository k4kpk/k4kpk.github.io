How to spot yourself for SOTA using APRS2SOTA....

Send an APRS message:

* To: SOTA
    * Note: No SSID. Just "SOTA" (or, if you must, SOTA-0)
* Message body (separate fields with spaces):
    * Summit-ID
    * Frequency in MHz
    * Mode (e.g. AM,CW,DATA,DV,FM,PSK,RTTY,SSB,OTHER)
    * call-sign
    * optional comment

e.g. Send the following to SOTA: 

    W4G/NG-001 14.344 SSB K4KPK hello from Brasstown Bald

Note:

* You do have to pre-register.  Send an email to misc at g0lgs.co.uk  (that's at g0Lgs).  I sent a few extra words, so it would be clear I was not a robot.  Be sure to provide your call sign.
* I've been asked whether the content must be upper/lower case.  I don't know.  In fact, I don't actually know how to switch upper/lower case on my HT, so it seems unlikely that case matters.
