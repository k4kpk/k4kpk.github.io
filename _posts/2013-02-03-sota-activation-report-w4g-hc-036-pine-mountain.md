SOTA Activation Report: W4G/HC-036 - Pine Mountain
----------------------------------------------
####Trip of 2012.11.20
* Succeeded: Yes
* First-activation: Yes

See my trip planning guide at: [SOTA Guide - W4G/HC-036 - Pine Mountain](http://k4kpk.com/content/sota-guide-w4ghc-036-pine-mountain)


Commentary:

Perfect weather, convenient site to Atlanta, moderate-level hike. For a bonus, my eldest son came along and listened in via a second set of headphones. We both had a great time.

It's a short, steep hike up from the west parking lot off Komatsu Drive in Cartersville. 20 meters was noise free and our chosen frequency was silent. (That's an advantage of a weekday activation!)

Contacts:

* 11 QSO at 10 watts on 20 meters - 14.345 MHz SSB
* Thank you chasers!

Radio: Elecraft KX3. 

* This is the first time I managed to get battery power and SWR just right to transmit with 10 watts. (Nothing wrong with the radio before this -- just operator error.)

Antenna I used:

* 20 meters - EFHW on 31' Jackite with EARCHI 20 meter matchbox. Bungee-corded it to the trunk of a twisted tree.
* I used a counterpoise of about 21-20 feet.
