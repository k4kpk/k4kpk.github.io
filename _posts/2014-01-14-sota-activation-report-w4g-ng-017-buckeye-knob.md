Commentary:

I had a sidekick today!  KG4ZGW came along on todays activations to observe.  (I invited him to operate, but he’s strictly interested in CW, and we didn’t bring a key.)  He’s the first ham to come along on one of my activations.    Shucks.  Given that I operate exclusively SOTA, he’s the first ham to observe me operate *anywhere*.  It was interesting to hear how my operation appears from the outside.

It was a cold activation on W4G/NG-017 (Buckeye Knob) this morning — about 15-20 degrees (Fahrenheit) and about 15-20 MPH wind.  For some, those might be balmy winter conditions, but here in Georgia, we consider that *cold*.  My fingers were numb, my face was numb, and my zip ties were brittle enough to break.  I was pretty close to aborting the trip, and we didn’t hang around long on the summit.

In the end, I’m glad we persisted.  I worked DJ5AV.  I always enjoy working someone overseas on my 12 watts, and since my ancestors came from Germany, I particularly enjoy logging another German contact.  (I’ve worked DJ5AV once before.)

Signals seemed a little weak this morning, and the number of chasers was down from recent weeks.  I was thinking that maybe propagation was off, but it can’t have been too bad or my signal wouldn’t have made it across the pond.  It’s possible I simply missed some chasers because I was only on the air for a total of 10 minutes. We were in a hurry to get off the mountain. (Did I mention it was cold?)

By the time we were packed, I was shivering and it felt good to generate some heat from walking, and it was really nice to turn up the heater back at the truck.

The sky was 100% clear and a beautiful winter blue.

I do not recommend attempting to drive to the trailhead for this summit in a passenger car.  From the Coosa Bald side, it is too bumpy/rocky and has a couple of challenging gullies.  From the Akin Mountain side, there were some big mud bogs which could swallow a compact car.

Thank you chasers!
