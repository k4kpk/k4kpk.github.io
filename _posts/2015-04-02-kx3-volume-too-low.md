My KX3 volume is too low.  When I crank up the volume to the max level, it is sometimes barely loud enough to hear.  Here's what's been suggested (and I'm working on testing).

* In the AGC menu adjust AGC THR (AGC threshold).
* Tap the TUNE button.
* Turn off NR.
* Check RF gain.  (Did that.  It is at max = 0.  Lower levels are negative.)
* Turn preamp on.
* Make sure you don't have an antenna problem.
* Swap between headphones and speaker.  (I've been using headphones.  The speaker will show me whether it is a problem with headphone sensitivity.)
