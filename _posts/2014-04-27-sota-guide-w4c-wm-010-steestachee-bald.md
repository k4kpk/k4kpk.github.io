#### Trail Guide

* **Duration**: 0.5 miles and 450' climb, 0:35 up, 0:25 down
* **Navigation**
    * Facing the picnic table from the parking lot, the trailhead is just to the left of the table.
    * Follow the trail that parallels the Parkway.
    * There are signs for the Mountains to Sea Trail (MST).  The MST heads NE, paralleling the Parkway.  The other direction on the MST heads downhill to the left.  Take the trail to the NE.
    * At 35.4126,-83.0431 there is a slight draw to your left.  This is where you begin your bushwhack.  Follow the draw up to the ridge.  Then follow the ridge to the summit.
    * It is a moderately difficult bushwhack due to the climb.  The undergrowth is not too bad in the brown season.  Navigating when the trees are green could be troublesome because you can't see very far.  It was still brown at this altitude on April 26, 2014.  Trees are just starting to bud.  By mid-May it will be tough to see through the leaves.
