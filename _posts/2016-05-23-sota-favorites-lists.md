## Home-runs (4 summits in one day)

* **Cohutta Wilderness**: [Dyer Mountain](http://k4kpk.com/content/sota-guide-w4ghc-009-dyer-mountain), [Flat Top Mountain](http://k4kpk.com/content/sota-guide-w4ghc-006-flat-top-mountain) (4WD required), [Cowpen Mountain](http://k4kpk.com/content/sota-guide-w4ghc-001-cowpen-mountain), [Bald Mountain](http://k4kpk.com/content/sota-guide-w4ghc-003-bald-mountain) - 36 points
* Richland, Steestachee, Barnett-or-Bunches, Waterrock.  I'm convinced you could make this a 5-way with Bunches Bald, but you'd need to be a superman and move fast.  I have to admit that I don't much like Steestachee, so the "favorite" here is just that a 4 or 5 summit day is amazing.

## Favorite Triple-headers

* [Black Balsam Knob](http://k4kpk.com/content/sota-guide-w4ccm-005-black-balsam-knob), [Green Knob](http://k4kpk.com/content/sota-guide-w4ccm-023-green-knob) (W4C/CM-023), [Mt Pisgah](http://k4kpk.com/content/sota-guide-w4ccm-011-mt-pisgah)
    * Blue Ridge Parkway SW of Asheville. The Blue Ridge Parkway is always beautiful.  Best to do Black Balsam early in the morning, before parking gets awful.  28 points.

## Favorite Summits

* Big Bald Mountain (W4G_HC-002) - Beautiful walk; long walk; carry waders.
* Black Balsam - Beautiful summit.  Scatter my ashes here when I die.
* Coosa Bald - short, steep trail.  Always cold.
* Huckleberry Knob (W4C_WM-011) - beautiful alpine field, with a relatively short hike.
* Max Patch (W4C_CM-036) - beautiful alpine field, with a short hike.

* Rabun Bald (W4G_NG-002) - observation deck

## On or Near the Blue Ridge Parkway

* Clingmans Dome
* Barnett Knob
* Waterrock Knob
* Richland Balsam
* Black Balsam Knob
* Mount Pisgah
* Mount Mitchell
* I avoid Greentop due to QRM. I don't often go to Bunches Bald because it belongs to the Cherokee and one really ought to seek permission from the campground operator.
