#### Summit Guide

The summit is filled with radio towers and guy lines.  The ground is a hard gravel parking lot.

A little off the summit, there are some trees in the activation zone.  There's a large clearing past the towers, but it is below the activation zone.

I strapped my mast to a post on the left, between the driveway to the first building and the big lot.  The post has a sign which says not to drive past that point.  It is overgrown, so it is hard to see.

2m frequently breaks squelch, perhaps from noise on 2m from the radios.  Mild RFI on 20m from transformers and air conditioning. 40m is clear.

* Cell coverage: APRS: message delivered but ACK not received in 2013, failed in 2014; Verizon: 1 of 3 succeeded (2014);  AT&T: no signal
* Unique features:
    * Ugly.  Covered with radio towers, weather towers, concrete buildings.

#### Plan-B Candidates

* None listed.
