Formulae, constants, laws, etc.

* Coulomb = C
    * Electrons per coulomb: \\( 6.241509745 * 10^{18} \\)
    * Coulombs per electron: \\( 1.602 x 10^{-19} \\)
* Coulomb's Law:

\\[ \left | F \right |= k_{e}\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r^{2}} \\]

* ... where
    * \\( k_{e} \\) is a constant
    * \\( q_{1} \\) is the charge of the first particle in Coulombs
    * \\( q_{2} \\) is the charge of the second particle in Coulombs
    * r is the distance between them in meters
    * F is the force in newtons
    * m is meters
    * N is Newtons
    * \\( k_{e}=8.988 \ast  10^{9} \frac{Nm^2}{C^2} \\)

* Meter: Abbreviated m.
* Centimeter: Abbreviated cm.
* Newton: Unit of force.  Force needed to accelerate 1 kilogram of mass at the rate of 1 meter per second squared.  Abbreviated N.
* Amp: Unit of current. Abbreviated A. 
    * Amps = Coulombs / seconds
    * \\(  A=\frac{C}{s}\\)
* Joule: Unit of work (or energy expended).  Abbreviated J.  Newtons * meters.
    * 1 Joule = passing an electric current of one amp through a resistance of one ohm for one second
    * Other measures of work/energy expended:
        * Watts * seconds
        * Coulombs * volts
* Volts are joules divided by coulombs.  i.e. 1V = \\( \frac{1J}{1C} \\)
* Watts:
    * Joules per second
    * Volts * Amps


* Current arrows
##### Forward (positive): 
![Forward current](/files/Current-Forward.png "Forward (positive)")

From plus, through to minus is forward (consuming power).

##### Reverse (negative):
![Reverse current](/files/Current-Reverse.png "Reverse (negative)")

From minus, through to plus is backward (generating power).

For voltages, + connected to + is forward.

##### Another way of diagramming the same thing

* Ohm's Law: 
    * v = iR
        * If current arrow is from minus, through to plus, then use v = -iR
    * \\( \Omega=\frac{V}{A} \\)
        * Volts / Amps
* Metric prefixes
    * k = kilo = \\( 10^{3} \\)
    * M = mega = \\( 10^{6} \\)
    * c = centi = \\( 10^{-2} \\)
    * m = milli = \\( 10^{-3} \\)
    * \\( \mu \\) = micro = \\( 10^{-6} \\)
* Kirchhoff's Current Law: The sum of all currents entering **a node** = the sum of all currents leaving **a node**.
* Resistors in series: \\( R_{1} + R_{2} + R_{3} \\)
* Resistors in parallel: \\( \left ( \frac{1}{R_{1}} + \frac{1}{R_{2}} + \frac{1}{R_{3}} \right )^{-1} \\) or use \\( \frac{R_1 R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \\)

* Voltage divider (using resistors in series): \\( v_1=\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2}v \\)

* Current divider (using resistors in parallel): \\( i_1=\frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2}i \\)

* Capacitance in Farads:
\\[ C = \frac{Q}{V} \\]
    * C = Farads
    * Q = Coulombs
    * V = Volts
* 1 microfarad = 1 \\( \mu \\)F \\( = 1 \times 10^{-6} \\) farad
* 1 picofarad =  1 pF = \\( 1 \times 10^{-12} \\) farad = 1 micro microfarad
