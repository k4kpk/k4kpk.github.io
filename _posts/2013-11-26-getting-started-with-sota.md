I collect notes on how to get started in SOTA here...

* [I'm in a hurry. What do I have to do to activate a summit?](/content/how-activate-summit-short-form)
* For your first summit, pick out a summit that is near home, get out there and try to activate it.  If it doesn't go well, you haven't invested a lot in it.  Pay attention to what worked and what didn't.  You'll learn a **lot** from your first attempt.  Then, adjust your plan so that the next time goes better.

* [What do I need to take to the summit? I'm planning to activate the summit myself.](/content/sota-activation-what-bring-activator-edition)
* [A sample activation trip plan](/content/my-summit-activation-plan)
* [Spotting](/content/what-sota-spotting)
* [Propagation forecasts](/content/propagation-forecasts-and-sota)
* [4 Wheel Drive](/content/sota-and-4-wheel-drive)
* [Rain or Snow](/content/sota-and-weather)
* [Contests](/content/contests-and-sota)
* [Download USGS Topographic Maps](http://store.usgs.gov/)
* [Read the word-wide SOTA reflector](http://www.sotawatch.org/reflector.php)
* [Read and subscribe to the North American SOTA Mailing List](http://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/nasota/info)
    * In addition to reading current posts, go back and read a year's worth of history, so you won't appear to be a newbie when you post.
* If you're in the Southeast:

    * [Patrick's GPS Traces from his activations](http://smkymtns.com/sota-gpx-tracks.html) (Patrick is an awesome activator.)
    * Forest Service road closures in GA - [http://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/conf/alerts-notices](http://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/conf/alerts-notices)
    * Winter bonus is 3 points on 8 and 10 point summits from  December 01 through March 15 in Georgia.
* Major SOTA Web Sites:
    * [http://sotadata.org.uk/](http://sotadata.org.uk/)
    * [http://sotawatch.org/](http://sotawatch.org/)
    * [http://sotamaps..org/](http://sotamaps.org/)
* Can I activate the same hill twice?  Yes.  You can activate a hill for points once per calendar year.  You can activate the hill a hundred times a week if you want -- but you can't get more points for it until the next calendar year.
