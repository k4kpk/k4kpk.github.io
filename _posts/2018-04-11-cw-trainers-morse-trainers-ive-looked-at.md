title: CW Trainers / Morse Trainers I've Looked At
---

A quick overview of some Morse/CW training programs.  There are others.  These are just the ones I've looked into.

I'm at a peculiar skill level -- I can copy random, perfectly-spaced characters at about 20 WPM.  I'm only good for 15 WPM if the text has meaning.  Moderate noise doesn't bother me too much.  A sloppy fist will slow me to about 10 WPM.  If I'm expecting a call sign and RST and you send me chatter, I'll get completely lost.

### I think these are interesting, for ordinary CW training:

* Lcwo.net - characters, random sentences, call signs.  Good place to start.  Learn characters and move on to another option.
* AA9PW.com/morsecode - characters, news headlines, simulated QSO.
* http://seiuchy.macache.com - short lines from a QSO. Optional bad fist.  No noise. Works on Safari, Firefox; not Chrome.
* G4FON trains random letters with noise and bad fist.  It does do some QSOs.  It does not do news headlines. Wine works.
* [http://morsecode.ninja](http://morsecode.ninja) Many hours of audio files from 15-50wpm+ in 2-3wpm increments. Has a SOTA Activators/Chasers audio file. 
* MorseRunner - I've decided this one is great practices for SOTA.  It is written as a contest trainer, with QRM,  QRN, and pileups, but the exchange is close enough to a SOTA exchange to be good practice for on-the-air.

### Maybe useful for specialty CW:

* RufzXP - just call signs, very fast.
* http://www.dxatlas.com/MorseRunner/ - contest simulation, with noise.

### I found nothing to interest me:

* Morse Mania - similar to AA9PW web site's simulated QSO. (I'd rather use the AA9PW web site. You *could* find this one useful if you need to run offline.)
* G4ILO Morse Machine - just characters.
* AD5RX doesn't run on current-generation Mac OS X.  (Maybe it was on PowerPC chip set?)
