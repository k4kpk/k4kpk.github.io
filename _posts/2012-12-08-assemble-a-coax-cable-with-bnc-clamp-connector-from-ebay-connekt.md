<p>I recently purchased some BNC connectors for PL-174 coax from eBay seller&nbsp;connekt. &nbsp;It took me a little while to figure out how to use them, so here&#39;s my notes.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/files/clamp_bnc_connekt.JPG" style="width: 430px; height: 410px;" /></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Cut cable to desired length.</li>
	<li>
		Put tape backstop on cable. &nbsp;(This is to keep the parts you slide onto the cable from sliding far down the cable.)</li>
	<li>
		Slide the screw connector onto the cable. (Item 1 in the image above -- The part of the connector through which the cable exits.)</li>
	<li>
		Slide on the big-hole metal washer. &nbsp;(Look closely. &nbsp;One has a little bigger hole. Item 3 in the above picture.)</li>
	<li>
		Slide on the rubber ring. (Item 4 in the picture.)</li>
	<li>
		Slide on the little-hole washer. (Item 5 in the picture.)</li>
	<li>
		THEN strip the end of the cable.
		<ul>
			<li>
				strip 3/4&quot; of jacket</li>
			<li>
				push back the braid</li>
			<li>
				Slide on the braid-spreading washer - tube-end first, washer last. &nbsp;(Item 2 in the picture.)</li>
			<li>
				shove it on snug</li>
			<li>
				splay the braid</li>
			<li>
				trim excess braid</li>
			<li>
				strip dielectric, leaving 1/16&quot; (a little less than thickness of the braid spreading washer)</li>
			<li>
				tin and trim center conductor of the cable. Leave the conductor about 1/16&quot; too long for the pin.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		screw it all together and test.</li>
</ul>
<p>This uses only contact/pressure to make contact between the center wire of the cable and the inside of the pin. &nbsp;I did one this way and I did one soldering the wire inside the pin. &nbsp;It is really tough to solder the wire inside the pin! &nbsp;We&#39;ll see if one lasts longer than the other. &nbsp;If the contact-only pins last, these are nice, easy-to-use connectors. &nbsp;If they don&#39;t, I&#39;ll stick with crimp connectors.</p>
