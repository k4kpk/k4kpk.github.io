* **Directions**:
    * Atlanta to Clayton GA - 1:45
        * I-285 E to I-85 N
        * I-985 N and go 23.8
        * Straight on US-23 N + US-441 for 52
    * From Clayton GA (intersection of US-441 and US-76) to trailhead - 0:30 :
		* Straight on US-441 N and go 6.7
	    * L on Bettys Creek Rd (Marathon Gas station on L, "Barkers Creek Mill" sign on R) and go 3.4
    	* L on Patterson Gap Rd (big "Moon Valley" sign on L) and go 1.5 (~ 6 minutes)
        	* Lake at 1.1.  Do not take driveway to R across from lake.
        	    * "Moon Valley" - Valley Springs Lodging cabin rentals.  Looks nice and peaceful. 706-746-3875.
        	* At 1.2, just past lake, take L fork (climbs);  R fork is Tarheel Ln and passes a 2nd lake at 1.5
        * Straight on USFS-32 and go 2.0 (about 15 minutes)
            * In March 2014, USFS-32 has some serious erosion gullies which sometimes cross the road.  In places, there was marginal fit between gully and road edge.  This is a bad road to take when wet.  It was only marginally drivable in my Corolla when dry.
    	* Park at Patterson Gap.  If you go 0.2 too far, the road makes a sharp 180 to the R.
    	    * Turn-out/parking to right.  Closed dirt road (with dirt piles to block) on R.
    	    * Side road to L.
    	    * Trail ~ 8' up the side road.
