Drive to Trailhead & Trail Guide
--------------------------------------------------------
#### Drive Guide - Toxaway Mountain from Atlanta

* **Duration**: 2:50, 148 miles
* **Google Maps** URL from Ashford Dunwoody Rd and I-285 at 33.91998, -84.33898: http://goo.gl/maps/3Bczs
* **Seasonal/Limited Access**: 
    * Paved public roads, except for last 200 yards on dirt road.
    * Tower Rd is a one lane paved road with turn outs.  It is a very slow drive.
* **Directions**:
    * I-285 to I-85 N and go 83
    * Exit 1, SC-11 N and go L 32.6
    * Bear L on SC-130 N and go 10.4
    * S on NC-281 and go 8.7
    * L on US-64 W and go 3
    * R on Black Oak Dr and then L on Black Oak Dr at T and go 0.2 past T
    * Bear L on Hickory Dr and go 1
    * R on Tower Rd at T and go 0.3
    * Acute L on Tower Rd after hairpin turn and go 0.4
    * R on Tower Rd and go 2
    * When road turns to dirt, you have 1/4 mile to drive or hike.  
        * There are 2 obvious turn-outs you could park in followed by a wide spot at some sheds just before you reach the summit.
        * It looks like the last driveway (on L) before the water tank turn-out on the R is the edge of the activation zone.  I ran down to the prior driveway (on R), to be sure I was out of the zone.
        * Note: on 9/27/2014, they had just finished paving the top part of the road.  There is about a 200 yard gap, from the last driveway, where the pavement ends, to the first turn-out, where the new pavement begins.  I don't know if they plan to pave the gap or leave it.  The gap would have been OK for my Corolla, but I scraped bottom at one point in my Prius.
    
* **Food**
    * Last McDonalds: Lavonia, GA at GA-17
    * Penultimate McDonalds: Commerce, GA at US-441

#### Trail Guide

* **Duration**: 0:15 (to exit and re-enter the zone; it is a drive-up)
* **Navigation**:  Follow the dirt road.  At the first turn-out (on the R), there is a dirt road to your right. You keep L.  KI4SVM operated from the 2nd turn-out (on the L)
* **Summit altitude**: 4777' at 35.1319, -82.9831
* **GPS tracks/waypoints**:
    * End of pavement: 35.131222, -82.983638

#### Summit Guide

* Hang antenna from tree: Y
* Space to guy mast: Y
* Cell coverage: AT&T=Y (with strong 3G); Vzn and APRS not tested but KI4SVM says they're good.
* Unique features: Fire tower, house, antenna farm on summit.  
    * I operated from the turn-out on the left, just below the summit.  I had no QRM, but there might be some on the summit.  The turn-out was a sandy mess.
    * Given the dense antenna farm on top and the unpleasant turn-out, I don't know that I'll do this site again.  If I do, I'll try the grassy summit. I have a portable SW receiver that I'll take and I'll use it to measure QRM on summit before setting up an antenna.
