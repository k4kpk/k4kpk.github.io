Trip-specific: Drive to Trailhead & Trail Guide
--------------------------------------------------------

#### Drive Guide - Bald Mountain

* **Duration**: 2:15
* **Google Maps** Online Google maps did a poor job of routing.  The iPhone Google Map app did a nice job of navigating to Lake Conasauga recreation area in July 2013.  (It gets you very close to the destination.) 
* **SOTA Extra Info Page**: http://sotawatch.org/summits.php?summit=w4g/ng-003
* **Seasonal/Limited Access**:
    * March 1 - December 31 (per http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/conf/recreation/hiking/recarea/?recid=10465&actid=104), and there are gates to prevent access (if they actually get closed).
* **Directions to Bald Mtn Trailhead**:
    * [See driving directions in my [Grassy Mtn](/content/sota-guide-w4ghc-007-grassy-mountain) guide.  The drive to Bald Mtn is 95% of the drive to Grassy Mtn.]
* **Food**: (See Grassy Mtn)
* **On the way home** (scouting/errands): Ellijay: Scout Burnt Mtn trailhead at 34.53747, -84.35771

#### Trail Guide

* **Duration**: 0:30
* **Navigation**
    * Follow the trail 0.5 miles. Starts northeast, then east, then northeast again.
    * The trail is basically straight up the mountain, with no descent.  It goes up, but it is probably the easiest of the Georgia 10-pointers, given the modest slope and short distance.  The actual summit is off the trail about 75' and is covered with evergreens, but the trail passes through the activation zone.
    * In summer, the trail and the summit are overgrown with greenery.  Bluejeans are advised, due to thorns crowing the trail.
* **Trailhead altitude**: 3621' @ Trailhead @ 34.86117, -84.63482
* **Summit altitude**: 4588'
* **GPS tracks/waypoints**:
    * Trailhead: 34.86117, -84.63482
    * Summit: 34.86450, -84.62830

#### Summit Guide

* Hang antenna from tree: Yes.
* Space to guy mast: Challenging in spring/summer, due to underbrush.
* Cell coverage: Verizon SMS, AT&T SMS (intermittent), and APRS -- all worked.
* Note that there are flush toilets at the picnic area at Lake Conasauga.  You have to pay $2 to park there, and don't forget that the picnic area isn't open for the full March-December season that the road is open.

#### Plan-B Candidates

* Grassy Mtn
