I have an assembled MTR 2 (Mountain Top'er from KD1JV).  I'm trying to figure out how to operate it.  Here are some notes.  I'm going to learn just the minimal functions, get on the air with them, and add additional functions to my repertoire as I need them.

* Turn it on: 
    * Plug it in.
* Change band: 
    * Set all 3 switches to one side or the other.
    * Either power on OR tap one of the buttons.
* Change keyer speed:
    * Hold Fn until "S" displayed.
    * Paddle-dit: Slower
    * Paddle-dah: Faster
* Save current frequency and keyer speed as power-on speed:
    * Hold Fn until "P" displayed.
    * Push up-arrow
* Tune up:
    * Tap/hold up-arrow
* Tune down:
    * Tap/hold down-arrow
