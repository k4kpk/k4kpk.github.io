I'm studying for the Amateur Extra Class license exam.  I want to pass, but I'm not seeking a perfect score.  (Perfection is not an effective use of my time.)  I'm willing to memorize facts but not answers.  The difference is that a fact is something useful after the exam.  

However, I will memorize an occasional answer or write-off a question if the amount of learning is enormous just to answer a few questions.

These are just the things I have to learn.  I'm not capturing things I already know, such as Ohms law.

https://hamstudy.org/extra2012 (the "Read Questions" link) is very helpful.  Many of the questions have explanations associated with the answers.

* Reminder: micro and mega both deal with a million (10**6).  Pico is million million (10**12).
* **Circulator** - a three- or four-port device, in which an RF signal entering any port is transmitted to the next port in rotation (only). 
* Receiver performance measures
    * MDS = Minimum Discernable Signal
    * **Dynamic range** = space between weakest signal radio can receive and strongest it can handle w/o excess distortion.
    * **Desense** (a.k.a. blocking) = close frequency at strong level drives RF amp to compression (non-linear behavior).
        * Narrowing receiver bandwidth reduces this because "close" means within the receiver passband.
    * **Cross-modulation** = modulation of a close frequency superimposes on desired frequency.
    * Phase noise in the local oscillator of a receiver can mix with nearby frequencies to interfere with the tuned frequency.  (It creates a signal that mixes with the nearby frequency.)
    * Blocking Dynamic Range = dB between noise floor and incoming signal level which will cause 1 dB of gain compression.  In effect, it is the signal strength range the receiver can handle.
* Intermodulation
    * **Intermodulation products** are the emissions at frequencies generated by the combination of two or more frequencies **in a non-linear device**, such as the output stage of a transmitter, or the input stage of a receiver (or corroded connections).  E.g. (f1 - 2*f2).  Mixing often occurs in a non-linear RF amp.
    * A circulator reduces intermod by preventing signals received in the transmitting antenna going back into the transmitter amplifier and mixing.
* 3rd order intercept
    * a 3rd order intercept of x db means that a pair of signals will theoretically generate a third-order intermodulation product with the same level as the input signals
    * 3rd order intermod products created within a receiver are of interest because the 3rd order product of two signals in the band of interest is also likely to be within the band
* Resonance
    * At resonance, the L and C components of an RLC circuit go to zero, leaving only R.
    * In *series*, when L and C cancel, you have lower total RLC impedance, so more current flows.  (This is like removing 2 of 3 resistors that are in a series. R goes down.)
    * In *parallel*, when L and C cancel, you have higher impedance between the two rails, so less current flows.  (This is like removing 2 of 3 resistors that are in parallel. R goes **up**.)
    * L and/or C shift the phase between voltage and current in opposite directions.  Ergo, at resonance, there is no shift because AC circuits that are resistive have no phase shift.
    * F = .159 / sqrt(LC)
        * Note: This is true when the units on L and C are similar.  (e.g. Farads and henries, or micro-farads and micro-henries.)  On the exam, they mix micro-henries with pico-farads, so you use: F = 1000 * .159 / sqrt(LC).
            * i.e. On the exam, calculate **F = .159 / sqrt(LC)** without regard for units, and then multiply by 1,000
* Time constant
    * One time constant = all but 37%.
        * e.g. Discharging to 37% in one time constant.
        * e.g. Charging to all but 37% (meaning charged to 63%) in one time constant.
    * Calculating a time constant: T = RC
        * On the test, if you forget, pick the answer that is closest to the microfarad value (for all calculate-the-TC questions)
* Q
    * Half_Power_Bandwidth = Frequency / Q.   [B = F/Q]
        * e.g. If Q = 10, and Frequency = 10 MHz, then Bandwidth = 1MHz.
        * e.g. If Q = 95, and Frequency = 1.8 MHz, then Bandwidth = 1.8 / 95 = 0.0189 MHz = 18.9 KHz. 
* Gates
    * The symbol for the AND gate is rounded. <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/AND_ANSI.svg/200px-AND_ANSI.svg.png" height="16" width="20">
    * The symbol for the OR gate looks like AND with a pointy rounded end. <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/OR_ANSI_Labelled.svg/240px-OR_ANSI_Labelled.svg.png" height="16" width="20">
    * A triangle is a no-op.
    * The symbol for Nxxx is a little circle at the tip of AND / OR / no-op
    * XOR (and XNOR) have a double line at the input side.  e.g. <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/XOR_ANSI.svg/100px-XOR_ANSI.svg.png"  height="16" width="20">
* **Phase-locked Loop** =  An electronic servo loop consisting of a phase detector, a low-pass filter, a voltage-controlled oscillator, and a stable reference oscillator.
* If no antenna reference is specified for gain, assume a dipole.  (Otherwise, EIRP = Effective Isotropic Radiated Power.)
* ERP:
    * Add up the dB gain and loss for total dB.  Call that TDB.
    * TPO = Transmitter Power Output
    * ERP = InverseLog(TDB/10) * TPO
    * On a TI-36X Pro Calculator, Double-tap [ex 10x] for InverseLog
        * Double-tap "ex 10x"
        * Open paren, TDB / 10, close paren
        * x TPO
    * e.g.
        * If watts is 50 and gain is - 4 dB - 2 dB -1 dB + 6 dB = -1 dB
       * press InverseLog (-1 / 10) * 50
       * press Enter
* On XY RLC charts, Resistance is to the right; inductance is up; capacitance is down. Pure L or C is way up/down; mixed is near mid-line.
* A sawtooth wave is made up of a sine wave plus all its harmonics.  A square wave is made up of a sine wave plus its odd harmonics.
* -174 dBm/Hz = The theoretical noise at the input of a perfect receiver
* Matches:
    * A **delta match** feeds at two places, each side of center.
    * A **gamma match** feeds at the center and off one side (like my Arrow VHF Yagi).
    * A **stub match** runs feed line and radiator in parallel near the feed point
* P-type uses holes; n-type uses electrons. P = positive, so it has holes (which are anti-electrons); N = Negative, so it has electrons (which are negative).
* VCC is supplied to MMIC (monolithic microwave integrated circuit) via resistor or a choke on the amplifier output.
* Spurious emissions must be down 43 dB
* A hot-carrier (Schottkey) diode is often used as a VHF/UHF detector/mixer.
* Digital protocols
    * JT65 is designed for moon-bounce
    * PSK31 is narrowest bandwidth.  31 baud and 31 Hz bandwidth. It uses variable-length characters.
    * MFSK16 is FSK with 16 tones; about 300 Hz bandwidth.
* 120V RMS is 170V peak-to-peak.  It is 120V * sqrt(2).
* An op-amp has high input impedance and low output impedance.  (This is what you want.  Low-drain input, and low-resistance output.)
* A marker generator can be used to calibrate a receiver.  (Send at a known frequency and see what frequency the receiver thinks it is.)
* a FET has gate, drain, and source
* A point-contact diode is a "cat's whisker" diode.
* P= I*I*R
    * This can be derived from P=EI and E=IR
* Deviation Ratio:
    * Modulation index = DeltaCarrier / Modulation
    * Deviation ratio = MaxDeltaCarrier / MaxModulation
    * Highest allowed modulation index for angle modulation = 1
* Space stations, Satellites, and Moon:
    * HF - not allowed on 30m (because that's CW-only)
    * VHF - only allowed on 2 meters
    * UHF - allowed on 70, 23, and 13 cm
    * Mode x/y - uplink before downlink.  (Must get TO the satellite before the signal comes FROM the satellite.) 
    * Moonbounce at 144.0 to 144.1 (First 100 KHz of 2 meter band).  Also at 432.0 to 432.1 (100 KHz, but not at bottom of 70 cm.)
    * Meteor from 10 to 2 meter (28 to 148 MHz).
    * Aurora and m**E**teor strike happens at the E-layer
* PSK31 - (Phase Shift Keying, 31-baud) has data rate close to typing speed, and has extremely narrow bandwidth
* Spread spectrum is permitted above 222 MHz
* Line-A takes a chunk out of the BOTTOM of the 70 cm band (400 MHz)
    * ("A" is the beginning of the alphabet; Line-A loses the beginning of the band; 400 MHz is the only band in the answers with multiple, close answers.)
* dB = 10 Log (x/y)
    * Log is base 10
    * e.g. 400x increase in power = 10 Log (400/1) = 26 dB
* A noise **blanker** briefly switches off the receiver when a **broadband spike** occurs. (Not "broadband white noise" and not a narrowband spike.)
* X,Y graphing of RLC:
    * R is to the **R**ight of the vertical axis.
    * L is up
    * C is down
    * Reactance of an inductor is 2pi * FL
    * Reactance of a capacitor is 1/(2pi * FC)
* Impurity atom that adds holes to a semiconductor = "Acceptor impurity".  (Mnemonic **A**tom and **A**cceptor.)
* Filter types:
    * Jones Filter - a type of crystal lattice filter
