Commentary:

Clingmans Dome is one of the highest points east of the Mississippi.  The summit is a short walk up from the parking lot.  It has an observation tower at the summit.  I was not brash enough to attempt an activation from the tower, though I did activate within sight of it.  A number of young people asked me what I was doing.  I had an experience that I often have: When I say I'm an amateur radio operator, I get blank looks, but when I say, "I set up a radio station and I talk to people from around the world," I get enthusiastic declarations of, "Cool!" 

Dark clouds were rolling in here, so I rushed through my activation again.  

I set up my antenna near the ramp, at its farthest point from the observation deck.  Next time, I'd like to try getting away from the deck, as I wonder if it interfered with my signal.  Or maybe bring sound-deadening headphones and a narrator/protector and set up on top of the tower.

Thank you chasers for your patience!
